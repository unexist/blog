If I had to name a currently trending topic I would surely pick [ChatGPT][] or rather the
underlying AI model [GPT-3][] with its upcoming pricier and more capable successor [GPT-4][].
Between all these news and probably related to my own technical bubble there is lots of progress
regarding AI-assistants for coding.

I had a look at both [CoPilot][] and [Tabnine][] back then, but I never tried to sort my own
thoughts about this whole idea.
So in this post I will try to bring these thoughts to paper and with both my operational and my
management hat on.

== What are these assistants?

The whole idea is actually pretty simple, if we put the inherent complexity of AI aside for now:

We train an AI model on available natural language and source code and allow it to give
recommendations based on the actual code an developer writes as a [prompt][].

So if you want to use a derogatory term here it is an auto-completion on steroids.

== What are they capable of?

The results of the code suggestions are nothing short of astonishing and can complete words,
single sentences als provide whole bodies of methods and functions:

On a side note: I also used Tabnine for this blog post just to demonstrate it is entirely possible
to write natural language with it:

== Pros

=== Faster time to market

In our industry there still exists the myth of a **10x developer** which is a really loose
description for an individual contributor with coding super powers.
I am not entirely sure, if this is solely based on the actual coded lines (hello [COCOMO][]) or
the quality of the code.

Still, AI can really speed up the creation of boilerplate code and initial stuff which cannot
easily be put into other artifacts like libraries or templates like [Maven Archetype][].

== Cons

=== License fees and other costs

Super powers never come for free - the same is true for the processing and storage power that is
required here from [OpenAI][] or the costs for the actual licenses.

My own experience is limited to CoPilot and Tabnine, but there are companies providing these
services aplenty.
Here are the current prices for the two services named - based on data at the time of this post's
writing:

|===
|Service|Individual costs (per month)|Business costs (per month per user)
|[CoPilot][]|$10 (or $100 per year)|$19
|[TabNine][]|$0 Starter / $12 Pro|Let's talk
|===

This are just the plain service costs and don't include any time to train staff or to create
proper company guidelines how to actually use these services.

=== Privacy

=== Closed customer systems

Dependent on the customer and obviously the industry there are legal limits which code can be used
as training data and even how the data can be accessed.

Training a model with data that is hidden inside of customer systems

=== Code duplication

I think in some ways it kind of behaves like copying code from [StackOverflow][] and it isn't clear,
if the code was provided in the question or in the accepted answer.

Also code suggestions mean the AI has seen this somewhere else and if we ignore any legal or
privacy concerns

=== Performance

Many services provide multiple ways of using the language model - but it typically boils down to
either run it locally or just use the cloud with more processing power and also more suggestions
due to the availability of training data.
