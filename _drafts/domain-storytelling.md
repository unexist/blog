In my previous post about
[Specification by Example]({% post_url 2021-09-09-specification-by-example %}) I pointed out, that
for me communication is a major problem within software projects and I suggested [specification
workshops][] as a way to transport the intent of a specific feature or task. This probably works
best in agile projects with short sprints, so that there is no need to define everything upfront.

What if we have to define everything upfront, because there are waterfall-y processes in place and
there is no short term plan to go agile?

## Specifications first

I probably know what you are thinking, but let us pretend we have a magic crystal ball and can
predict the distant future. I'd like to shift our focus to some other problems:

### What is the targeted audience?

Writing in general is difficult. When you are an expert in some field, you have a good depth of
knowledge and you automatically assume the reader of your specification shares this depth. This
obviously leads to a lack of detail and overall looser descriptions. I haven't checked this yet, but
I assume the manual on how to remove a combustion engine from a car for technical folks is
something, that I don't easily grasp.

**Hint**: A nice trick from the agile community is to define [personas][] for the targeted
audience. They create a fictional person, fill in some details like hobbies (sometimes even
pictures) and then try to impersonate this person while writing stories.

### What do you mean by that?

Have you ever been present, when you two doctors talk about medical findings? They probably used
lots of unknown words or ones with different meaning in their specific context. This is especially
helpful in anatomy, to rule out ambiguity, but makes it really complicated for the uninitiated to
follow.

**Hint**: In [Domain-Driven Design][] the concept of an [ubiquitous language][] is an essential
part of the domain model. It evolves along with the model and helps all participants to ~~sound like
doctors~~ reduce ambiguity.

### When is long too long?

The length of a specification is also a difficult topic. It should include everything that is
required to understand

## Domain Storytelling

I recently stumbled upon a new method to model
[Domain Storytelling][] is collaborative and graphical modelling tool
