data lake efficiently and securely stores, manages, and analyzes large amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

== Apache Iceberg

{% plantuml %}
!theme unexist from ../assets/plantuml
left to right direction

database "Catalog Layer" {
  [Catalog]
}

node "Metadata Layer" {
  [Metadata File]
  [Manifest List]
  [Manifest File]
}


node "Data Layer" {
  [Data Files]
}

[Catalog] --> [Metadata File]
[Metadata File] --> [Manifest List]
[Manifest List] --> [Manifest File]
[Manifest File] --> [Data Files]
