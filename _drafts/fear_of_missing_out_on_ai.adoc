It has been roughly two years since my last post regarding my experience with the state of AI
({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2023-04-28-coding-with-ai %}[Coding with AI]) and I think it is about
time to talk about this again.

But in contrast to the previous post, this time I don't want to dwell on specific products and
tools, but to explain why I think we should pay close attention to the development and why this
topic is generally such a mixed bag to me.

Enough chit-chat, let us begin.

== Omnipresence in media

When I look back at the last two years I can safely say the whole thing got even more traction, as
we've left the early adopting phase and there are daily new innovative ideas in media.

- AI has entered the mainstream and almost everything gets AI support.
- Content is specially {MCP}[prepared for AI systems] without following {mcprcp}[best practices].
- There is an abundance of new tools and new companies sprout like {popup}[pop-up stores].
- There are trials to replace {laborai}[general human labor] and even highly specific ones like
{nurseai}[nurses in healthcare].
- There are promises {billgates}[AI reduces our daily working time].

So in hindsight everything went according to plan from 2023:

== Asking the right questions

During the two years I've read quite a few articles about AI and related stuff including the books
{tamingsiliconvalley}[Taming Silicon Valley] <<tamingsiliconvalleybook>> and the entertaining
{theaicon}[The AI Con] <<theaiconbook>> and begin to wonder what kind of problems are we trying
to address really with AI?

If I look at the business side I'd say the overall themes are *increase of
productivityfootnote:[Read: getting faster]* like reducing tiresome and/or manual labor and
probably *fear of missing out* competitive advantage.
And on the personal side I mostly see quality-of-life improvements like easy *access to information*
with the help of the natural interfaces like {chatgpt}[ChatGPT]footnote:[Or just "Chatty" as I've learned recently]
and generational parts to create memes and reels more easily.

These aren't the only applications mind you, but they are sufficient for the points I'd like to
make next.

=== Increase of productivity

Increasing productivity and reducing work time with technology isn't strictly speaking a new idea,
[line-through]#blue collar# industrial workers faced this already during the mid-19th century
during the {industrialage}[industrial age], but for the first time
[line-through]#white collar# knowledge workers are impacted, and they aren't backed by any
{labourmovement}[labour union].

Back then there were lots of riots and protests according to Wikipedia, so the workforce probably
wasn't all happy with the outcome, but we aren't there *yet*, so let us focus on the promise of
improved work-life-balance.

Interestingly during that time a strange phenomenon could be observed:

[quote,David Graeber,https://davidgraeber.org/articles/on-the-phenomenon-of-bullshit-jobs-a-work-rant]
But rather than allowing a massive reduction of working hours to free the world’s population to
pursue their own projects, pleasures, visions, and ideas, we have seen the ballooning of not even
so much of the ‘service’ sector as of the administrative sector, up to and including the creation
of whole new industries like financial services or telemarketing, or the unprecedented expansion of
sectors like corporate law, academic and health administration, human resources, and public
relations. And these numbers do not even reflect on all those people whose job is to provide
administrative, technical, or security support for these industries, or for that matter the whole
host of ancillary industries (dog-washers, all-night pizza delivery) that only exist because
everyone else is spending so much of their time working in all the other ones.
These are what I propose to call ‘*bullshit jobsfootnote:[Emphasis is mine]*’.

This is just an excerpt of an article written for a magazine under the umbrella of things nobody
would print, as the author points out in {bullshitjobsbook}[Bullshit Jobs] <<bullshitjobsbook>>,
but still the term sounds right to me and also hits a mark.
There are a lot more examples and explanations in the book, but the really concerning part to me is
the implied question what can our highly skilled workforce do for a living, when their field of
expertise has been replaced with automatons?

[quote,David Graeber,https://davidgraeber.org/articles/on-the-phenomenon-of-bullshit-jobs-a-work-rant]
Hell is a collection of individuals who are spending the bulk of their time working on a task they
don't like and are not especially good at. Say they were hired because they were excellent
cabinet-makers, and then discover they are expected to spend a great deal of their time frying fish.

Another issue I see with increasing productivity is the orientation towards through- or rather
output in information related topics.
Viewed from the business side increasing quantity makes total sense to me, this is what the business
has been created for in the first place, but is output the only and ulterior goal and the learning
how to reach and achieve something can be totally neglected?

=== Fear of missing out

If your media feeds are like mine, there is probably something about AI every two or three posts
and depending on the kind of media, like e.g. {linkedin}[LinkedIn], the posts are full of promised
land and how the full potential of AI can be utilized for your business.

Oftentimes they appear to be written with the help of AI and can therefore easily be
{spotai}[spotted], but I count this as as
{dogfood}[eating your own dog food], which is actually fine.
What I can rarely find is some kind of empirical evince or any other proof for these and I consider
this usually as a red flag - skepticism can help here.

The current hype is so huge, academia also started looking into the phenomenon of
{aifomo}[development of fear of missing out on AI].

=== Access to information

Speaking of something really positive:
AI does a splendid job of lowering the bare to access information!
Hallucinations vary between dangerous and hilarious and some people are bold enough to state this
is an original {hallucinations}[feature of LLM design], but I think we
have already established media consumption *should* IMHO always happen with a bit of skepticism.

[quote,Ben Morris,https://www.ben-morris.com/ai-and-the-creeping-enshittification-of-work]
After all, who are you writing for? Do you care if anybody reads it and how they respond to it?
How can you expect anybody to relate to a piece of writing if it was generated by an AI model?
If you can’t be bothered to write the entire article, you can’t really expect anybody else to be
bothered to read it.

== Impact on society

I've seen so many questionable posts from Sam Altman, but this one makes perfect sense to me:

== Conclusion

I am just tired of AI - it is just everywhere and I don't see any real benefit for me.
