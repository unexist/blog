Handling containers is probably something a modern developer can't and probably *should* not live
without anymore.
They provide flexibility, allow easy packaging and also sandboxing of stuff you might not want
to have installed on your machine.

Like so often in tech, using something successfully doesn't imply real understanding how it
works under the hood, but I lived quite happily with this black box and all greasy details
shrouded in mysteries.
This changed, when I started looking for an artifact store for our firmware binary artifacts.
I quickly discovered there are many container registries available, but just a few stores for
_ordinary_ artifacts without spending large parts of our engineering budget on enterprise
license fees.
Asking my bubble, a good friend suggested to have a look at [Oras][], which leverages
[OCI][]-compliant registries for exactly what I wanted to archive.
We are already using Harbor][], so moving other artifacts there as well directly aroused my
interest.

So over the course of this article we are going to dive into the container world with a short
primer of the duality of OCI, talk about basic usage and a few advanced points like [SBOM][]
and signing and conclude with my impression on the technology.

NOTE: Feel free to skip the next section, if you are well versed in it, but also feel strongly invited
to correct me if I have gotten something wrong.
