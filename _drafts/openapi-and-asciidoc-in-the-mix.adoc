I am getting more and more obsessed with centralized documentation and this isn't because I enjoy
writing documentation (which I unfortunately really do), but more due sheer lack of it in my day
job and all the related issues we are currently facing.

Pushing ideas like the one from my previous post
({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2024-12-26-bringing-documentation-together %}[Bringing documentation together])
certainly helps to make writing docs easier, but are still some loose ends to follow - like API.

So this post is going to demonstrate how [OpenAPI][] (or formerly [Swagger][]) can be converted
into shiny [AsciiDoc][] and be brought into the mix.

== Why OpenAPI?

There are many ways to document API (mind you any documentation is better than none!), but keeping
established standards like [OpenAPI][] and [AsyncAPI][] (which isn't to far off) really help to
keep the cognitive churn low while trying to understand what a document is trying to convey.

And from a developer's perspective there are many low-hanging fruits:

- Code-first or API-first - you decide
- Many generators in both directions available - like [ktor-openapi-tools][] used in the example
- Tools like [Swagger UI][] and [Redoc][]
- Comes pre-assembled with a testing tool

TIP: Still not sold? <https://swagger.io/blog/api-strategy/benefits-of-openapi-api-development/>

== Converting to AsciiDoc

Again, there are dozens of options to select from..
Since I rely on the [confluence publisher plugin][] my initial pick was something with
[Maven][]-integration as well, but unfortunately [swagger2asciidoc][] has been unmaintained for
quite some time.
I actually tried to use it, but this was more like an educative endeavor for learning what happens
to neglected packages.

The next best option and probably should have been my first pick anyway is OpenAPI with its
exhaustive list of generators.
They offer a plethora of different ways to convert specs and thankfully
[AsciiDoc is among them][].

If we omit all nitty-gritty details it boils down to this call:

[source,shell]
----
$ openapi-generator-cli generate -g asciidoc \
    --skip-validate-spec \ # <.>
    --input-spec=src/site/asciidoc/spec/openapi.json \
    --output=src/site/asciidoc # <.>
----
<.> Let us ignore version handling and maturity of my own spec for now
<.> This is my preferred structure for Maven-based documentations

TIP: This can also be run from a container, see either [openapi-generator-cli][] or have a look
at my [containerfile][] for even more dependencies.

When everything works well a resulting document like this can be viewed:

== Customizing the document

One of the strong points of AsciiDoc is surely its extensibility and this also true for the
generator pipeline we are using now.

Per default, the generator offers a lot of different entrypoints to provide custom content for
inclusion in the final document, without doing fancy hacks like e.g. an include of the generated
document in your own one.

If you have a closer look at the actual generated document you can see lots of commented out
includes like:

[source,adoc]
----
[abstract]
.Abstract
Simple todo service


// markup not found, no include::{specDir}intro.adoc[opts=optional]
----

An introduction sounds like a good idea, so we could use the space there to inform our readers
about the automatic updates of the document:

[source,shell]
----
$ cat asciidoc/src/site/asciidoc/spec/intro.adoc
[CAUTION]
This page is updated automatically, please do *not* edit manually.
----

:fn-templates: footnote:templates[This might be misleading due to the integration of [Mustache][], but what are they actually called?]

After that we have to tell the generator to actually include our document.
When started, it is looking for these `templates`.{fn-templates}
inside the `specDir`, something we haven't set before, but we are quite able to do.

This only requires a minor change of our previous commandline:

[source,shell]
----
$ openapi-generator-cli generate -g asciidoc \
    --skip-validate-spec \ # <.>
    --input-spec=src/site/asciidoc/spec/openapi.json \
    --output=src/site/asciidoc \
    --additional-properties=specDir=spec/,useIntroduction=true # <.>
----
<.> [Additional properties][] can be used to pass down configuration directly to the AsciiDoc renderer

And hopefully, a run of the above rewards with an output like this:

image::introduction.png[]

There are many more templates that can be filled and I would gladly supply a list, but at the time
of writing I just can offer to grep the document on your own:

[source,shell]
----
$ \grep -m 5 "// markup not found" src/site/asciidoc/index.adoc
// markup not found, no include::{specDir}todo/POST/spec.adoc[opts=optional]
// markup not found, no include::{snippetDir}todo/POST/http-request.adoc[opts=optional] # <.>
// markup not found, no include::{snippetDir}todo/POST/http-response.adoc[opts=optional]
// markup not found, no include::{specDir}todo/POST/implementation.adoc[opts=optional]
// markup not found, no include::{specDir}todo/\{id\}/DELETE/spec.adoc[opts=optional]
----
<.> Looks like we can also supply snippets to the example sections - neat!

[WARNING]
====
During my tests I stumbled upon a weird behavior, whereas there are different checks per index
and generation phase, which have different requirements to the actual path.

This made it necessary for me to fix this with a symlink in my builds:

[source,shell]
----
$ podman run --rm -v .:/openapi -it docker.io/unexist/openapi-builder:0.3 \
  sh -c "cd /openapi \
    && ln -s asciidoc/src/site/asciidoc/spec spec \ # <.>
    && openapi-generator-cli generate -g asciidoc \
        --skip-validate-spec \
        --input-spec=asciidoc/src/site/asciidoc/spec/openapi.json \
        --output=asciidoc/src/site/asciidoc \
        --additional-properties=specDir=spec/,useIntroduction=true' \
    && unlink spec" # <.>
----
<.> Nasty I know, but maybe I got a response to this when you actually read this post:
<https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/20996>
<.> Just tidy up afterwards or rather skip altogether in a container
====

== Publish the document

I think this is the third time I tease how everything can be pushed to [Confluence][], but since
I don't run any personal instance just feel teased again:

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn -f pom.xml \
    -DCONFLUENCE_URL="unexist.blog" \
    -DCONFLUENCE_SPACE_KEY="UXT" \
    -DCONFLUENCE_ANCESTOR_ID="123" \
    -DCONFLUENCE_USER="unexist" \
    -DCONFLUENCE_TOKEN="secret123" \
    -P generate-docs-and-publish generate-resources
----

== Conclusion

What have we done here?
Strictly speaking this doesn't bring much advantages, especially when the tooling for OpenAPI
