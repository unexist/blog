Lately, I am more and more interested in communication or rather the lack and the manifold problems
related to it.
Sometimes I even think we as a discipline haven't learned much from the past or otherwise some
books like the {}[Mystery Man-Month] from the 80s wouldn't have aged so well.

Communication is hard, especially when you try to explain something to another human being or try
to explore a completely new domain on your own.
