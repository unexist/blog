Looking into something more deeply usually has the nice benefit of completely changing your own
point about it.
This can also promote something from a mere [buzzword][] to a buzzword with some nice and technical
implications.

When reading about [Data Les][] the interesting part for me was the fact the data there is
basically "schema-less" until you try to read it again.
Which brings us to the question how does the data gets there in the first place?

So in this blog post we are going to set up a single-container-data-lake and play with two
ways of moving data from our demo [todo][] application into it.

== Setting everything up

== Debezium, the WAL and an Iceberg

== Scala with a Spark
