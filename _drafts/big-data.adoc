Looking into something more deeply usually has the nice benefit of completely changing your own
point about it.
This can also promote something from a mere [buzzword][] to a buzzword with some nice and technical
implications.

When reading about [big data][] the interesting part for me was the fact the data there is
basically "schema-less" until you try to read it again.
