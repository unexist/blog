I've come a bit late to [Big Data][] game and there is no surprise that even things like
[MapReduce][] have some strong contenders even on its own platform.

During the course of this third post we are going to have a look at probably the strongest
contender [Apache Spark][] and its general architecture.
Afterward we tinker with a few examples and conclude with a comparison to the original
computing model of [MapReduce][].

Ready?
Onwards!

TIP: If you've missed the previous posts just have a look over here
     <https://unexist.blog/big-data/2023/10/27/big-data.html> and here
     <https://unexist.blog/big-data/2024/01/05/mapreduce.html>.

== What is Spark?

Like MapReduce, Spark is an open-source distributed framework geared towards processing of
large quantities of data for e.g. analytics in a rather unified approach.
It provides a whole platform for writing Big Data applications under a single umbrella and offers
a wide range of support for existing technologies.

It can make use of [cluster managers][] like [Hadoop YARN][], [Apache Mesos][] or [Kubernetes][],
but also supports running in standalone mode even on a single machine.

And this unification idea doesn't stop at the persistence level:
There is support for traditional storage systems including but not limited to [AWS S3][] and
obviously [HDFS][], but it also covers messaging systems like [Kafka[][].

All of these components integrate seamless into the same application and can be assembled from
different API in its primary language [Scala][], but also in the supported programming languages
[Java[], [Python][], [SQL][] and [R][].

This powerful combination allows a great deal of different data tasks ranging from simple data
loading, SQL queries and up to streaming computation.

=== Architecture overview

On a high-level, Spark consist of following main components:

++++
{% plantuml %}
!theme unexist from {{ site.asciidoctor_attributes.plantumldir }}

skinparam linetype ortho
skinparam nodesep 5
skinparam ranksep 5

together {
    card "Driver program (1)" as driver {
      rectangle "Spark context" as context
    }

    card "Execution engine (2)" as engine {
        rectangle "RDD" as rdd
        rectangle "DAG" as dag
    }
}

card "Cluster manager (3)" as cluster {
    rectangle "Standalone"
    rectangle "Apache Mesos"
    rectangle "Kubernetes"
    rectangle "Hadoop YARN"
}

together {
    card "Worker node (4)" as worker {
          card "Executor (5)" as exec {
              rectangle "Cache (6)" as cache
              file "Task" as task1
              file "Task" as task2
          }
    }

    card "Storage (7)" as storage {
        rectangle "Hadoop HDFS" as hdfs
        rectangle "AWS S3" as s3
    }
}

driver -r--> engine
engine -d--> cluster
cluster -r--> worker
worker -d--> storage

driver -[hidden]d-> worker
cluster -[hidden]r-> worker
worker -[hidden]d-> storage

rdd -[hidden]r-> dag

cache -[hidden]r-> task1
task1 -[hidden]r-> task2

{% endplantuml %}
++++
<1> The **driver** runs and coordinates the main program, maintains state, handles input and
analyzes, distributes and schedules work.
<2> Inside of the **execution engine** changes on immutable
**Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD)** are translated into a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**,
split into stages and ultimately into tasks
<3> A **cluster manager** manages and schedules tasks and keeps track of the resources
<4> **Worker nodes** execute the tasks and assign partions (units of work) to executors
<5> **Executors** are the working horse of Spark, directly execute jobs and cache the data on the outset
<6> This is actually the secret ingredient - the **cache** heavily speeds up processing
<7> And at the bottom is a storage layer for the results

== Spark applications

Spark applications can be run in local or **client mode** in a single [JVM][] instance,
which is perfectly suited for first steps with tools like [pyspark][].
In this mode the driver stays where **spark-submit** actually runs:

++++
{% plantuml %}
!theme unexist from {{ site.asciidoctor_attributes.plantumldir }}

skinparam linetype ortho
skinparam nodesep 20
skinparam ranksep 20

card "Development environment" as dev {
    rectangle "Driver" as driver
    rectangle "Spark context" as context
}

card "Cluster" as cluster {
    rectangle "Master" as master
    rectangle "Worker" as worker
}

dev -> cluster

dev -[hidden]> driver
master -[hidden]> worker
{% endplantuml %}
++++

This is in contrast to the **cluster mode**, which utilizes cluster technology and moves the
driver inside the cluster:

++++
{% plantuml %}
!theme unexist from {{ site.asciidoctor_attributes.plantumldir }}
skinparam linetype ortho
skinparam nodesep 20
skinparam ranksep 20
card "Development environment" as dev {
    rectangle "Spark context" as context
}

card "Cluster" as cluster {
    rectangle "Driver" as driver
    rectangle "Master" as master
    rectangle "Worker" as worker
}

dev -> cluster

dev -[hidden]> driver
master -[hidden]> worker
{% endplantuml %}
++++

Setting up a cluster takes some time and pain, so for the remainder of this blog
we just stay in **standalone** mode.
There is sufficient prowess for us to reap.

=== Installation

In order to run the examples on your own there should be a Spark installation up and running on
your machine.
Since networking in containers can be nasty, especially with the architecture of clustered systems
like Hadoop and Spark, we just run it locally.

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -sL https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-3.5.1/spark-3.5.1-bin-hadoop3.tgz | tar xz -C .
$ cd spark-3.5.1-bin-hadoop3

$ sbin/start-master.sh
starting org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master, logging to /home/unexist/applications/spark-3.5.1-bin-hadoop3/logs/spark-unexist-org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master-1-meanas.out

$ sbin/start-worker.sh spark://localhost:7077
starting org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker, logging to /home/unexist/applications/spark-3.5.1-bin-hadoop3/logs/spark-unexist-org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker-1-meanas.out
----

When both services are up and running you should be greeted with following page, when you
kindly point your browser to : <http://localhost:8080/>

TIP: If you still favor containers and insist, here is [Dockerfile][] for a kickstart, but consider
yourself warned.
<https://github.com/unexist/showcase-hadoop-cdc-quarkus/blob/master/podman/spark/Dockerfile>

Everything set?
Time for fun now!

=== Examples

Big Data without actual data kind of beats the whole idea, so we again rely on our simple
[todo application][] or rather its really simple data model.
If you haven't seen it before, it just looks like this and should be easy to grasp:

++++
{% plantuml %}
!theme unexist from {{ site.asciidoctor_attributes.plantumldir }}

skinparam linetype ortho
skinparam nodesep 30
skinparam ranksep 30

{% raw %}
file in0 [
{{json
  {
    "title":"string","description":"string","done":false,"dueDate":{"start":"2020-05-07","due":"2021-05-07"},"id":0
  }
}}
]
{% endraw %}
{% endplantuml %}
++++

TIP: More complexity required? Data like this can also be easily written to an underlying HDFS store:
<https://github.com/unexist/showcase-hadoop-cdc-quarkus/blob/master/todo-service-hadoop>

==== Spark shell

The first example starts low and utilizes the Spark shell.
It basically acts as a kind of Scala [REPL][] and is an ideal start for experimentation with the
API and the building blocks, especially if you've never touched Scala before:

[source,shell]
----
scala> import spark.implicits._
import spark.implicits._

scala> val todoDF = spark.read.json("/home/unexist/todo.json") // <1>
todoDF: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [description: string, done: boolean ... 3 more fields]

scala> todoDF.printSchema() // <2>
root
 |-- description: string (nullable = true)
 |-- done: boolean (nullable = true)
 |-- dueDate: struct (nullable = true)
 |    |-- due: string (nullable = true)
 |    |-- start: string (nullable = true)
 |-- id: long (nullable = true)
 |-- title: string (nullable = true)

scala> todoDF.createOrReplaceTempView("todo") // <3>

scala> val idDF = spark.sql("SELECT id, title, done FROM todo WHERE id = 0") // <4>
idDF: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [description: string, done: boolean ... 3 more fields]

scala> idDF.show() // <5>
+---+------+-----+
| id| title| done|
+---+------+-----+
|  0|string|false|
+---+------+-----+
----
<1> The REPL creates a [Spark session][] automatically, and we can directly start ingesting JSON data
<2> Spark knows how to handle JSON and provides us with a matching [DataFrame][]
<3> Dataframes are mainly simple data structures and can be easily used to create the [SQL view][] **todo**
<4> Once created the view can be accessed like any normal view with SQL
<5> Evaluations of dataframes are lazy and evaluated only when required like to generate output

==== Kafka streaming

The next example adds some more complexity and demonstrates the streaming abilities of Kafka in
combination with Spark.

Again, the standalone version is more than enough, but additionally we need Kafka.
Kafka can be a problem class of its own, but thankfully we have with [RedPanda][] another more
light-weight contender readily available.

If you did go the container way, installing it is quite easy otherwise please consult the
really good [quickstart guide][].

[source,shell]
----
$ podman run -dit --name redpanda --pod=hadoop docker.io/vectorized/redpanda
...
9a084aa8d6fc79a29040f1575ead1dd097d3ec6ce444c7a39018ad251bc406b0
----

Let us have a look at the source code:

[source,scala]
----
object TodoSparkSinkSimple {
    def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
        val sparkConf = new SparkConf() // <1>
            .set("packages", "org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.3.1")
            .set("spark.cores.max", "1")

        val spark = SparkSession // <2>
            .builder()
            .config(sparkConf)
            .appName("TodoSparkSink")
            .getOrCreate()

        import spark.implicits._

        val df = spark.readStream // <3>
            .format("kafka")
            .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092")
            .option("subscribe", "todo_created")
            .option("checkpointLocation", "/tmp/checkpoint")
            .load()

        val dataFrame = df.selectExpr("CAST(key AS STRING)", "CAST(value AS STRING)")
        val resDF = dataFrame.as[(String, String)].toDF("key", "value")

        resDF.writeStream // <4>
          .format("console")
          .outputMode("append")
          .start()
          .awaitTermination()
    }
}
----
<1> Pass the necessary configuration
<2> Create the Spark session
<3> Read the Kafka stream from given server and topic
<4> Write the output to the console back to a file of the catalog continuously

The compilation of the jar files and rolling the package is a breeze:

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn clean package
...
[INFO] --- jar:3.3.0:jar (default-jar) @ todo-spark-sink ---
[INFO] Building jar: /home/unexist/projects/showcase-hadoop-cdc-quarkus/todo-spark-sink/target/todo-spark-sink-0.1.jar
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  20.348 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2024-03-19T16:07:05+01:00
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

Another tick on our check-list - done.
Before we can actually submit the job there better should be something available on a topic
for our job to consume.

Another handy tool when you work with Kafka is [kcat][], which allows to send content to and
read directly from the shell:

[source,shell]
----
echo '{ "description": "string", "done": true, "dueDate": { "due": "2021-05-07", "start": "2021-05-07" }, "title": "string" }' | kcat -t todo_created -b localhost:9092 -k todo -P
----

And finally it is time to actually submit the configured job:

[source,shell]
----
$ spark-submit --master spark://${HOST}:7077 \
    --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.5.1 \
    --conf spark.executorEnv.JAVA_HOME=${JAVA_HOME} \
    --conf spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.JAVA_HOME=${JAVA_HOME} \
    --conf spark.sql.streaming.checkpointLocation=/tmp/checkpoint \
    --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=false \
    --name todosink \
    --deploy-mode client \
    --num-executors 1 \
    --executor-cores 1 \
    --driver-memory 1G \
    --executor-memory 1G \
    --class dev.unexist.showcase.todo.TodoSparkSinkToConsole \
    ./target/todo-spark-sink-0.1.jar
----

The actual outpot of the job is quite messy, but look out for the batch information:

[source,log]
++++
-------------------------------------------
Batch: 1
-------------------------------------------
+----+--------------------+
| key|               value|
+----+--------------------+
|todo|{ "description": ...|
+----+--------------------+
++++
