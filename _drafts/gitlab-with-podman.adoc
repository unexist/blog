== Gitlab with Podman

The ultimate goal for my previous post about [Dagger][] was to demonstrate the combination of it
with [Gitlab][] and [Podman][], but unfortunately I ran into so many different problems I made the
decision to break it apart.

This is second part of a small series and explains how to set up Gitlab with Podman-in-Podman
and various pitfalls along the way.

NOTE: If you are looking for the first part just follow this link over here:

{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2024-05-15-building-with-dagger %}[Building with Dagger].

=== Preparations

The first step in order to start Gitlab is to provide an SSL cert, but to make this a lot more
interesting we rely on a self-signed one:

[source,shell]
----
$ openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha512 -days 365 -nodes \
    -out gitlab.crt -keyout gitlab.key \
    -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:gitlab" \ # <.>
    -subj "/C=DE/ST=DE/L=DE/O=unexist.dev/OU=showcase/CN=gitlab" # <.>
----
<.> This line is essential, otherwise Gitlab won't accept this cert
<.> We are going to use *gitlab* for the hostname, so make sure to add it to your hosts file

Next up is the actual config of Gitlab.

There is aplenty that can actually be configured beforehand, especially in
[memory constrained environments][] it is beneficial to disable services like [Prometheus][], but
here we trust in [convention over configuration][] and just include only the bare minimum to
run Gitlab:

[source,ruby]
----
external_url 'https://gitlab:10443/'
registry_external_url 'https://gitlab:4567' # <1>

registry_nginx['enable'] = true
registry_nginx['listen_port'] = 4567 # <2>

nginx['ssl_certificate'] = "/etc/gitlab/ssl/gitlab.crt"
nginx['ssl_certificate_key'] = "/etc/gitlab/ssl/gitlab.key"
nginx['listen_port'] = 10443 # <3>
----
<1> Setting the ports here causes problems elsewhere, so better also set the ports in <2> and <3>
<2> My initial idea was to use the registry as a cache, but more to that later
<3> Nginx usually picks the port from _external_url_, which is not what we want to do

Like [Kubernetes][], Podman allows to group or rather encapsulate containers in [pods][] and also to
convert them afterward, so let us quickly create one:

[source,shell]
----
$ podman pod create -n showcase --network bridge  \
        -p 10022:22 `# Gitlab ssh` \
        -p 10443:10443 `# Gitlab web` \
        -p 4567:4567 `# Gitlab registry`
e91d11fdeb168c5713c9f48a50ab736db59d88ae7e39b807371923dcf4f26199
----

TIP: This can be done with the make target `pd-pod-create`.

==== Starting Gitlab

Once everything is in place we can fire up Gitlab:

[source,shell]
----
$ podman run -dit --name gitlab --pod=gitlab \
    --memory=4096m --cpus=4 \
    -v ./gitlab.crt:/etc/gitlab/ssl/gitlab.crt \ # <.>
    -v ./gitlab.key:/etc/gitlab/ssl/gitlab.key \
    -v ./gitlab.rb:/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb \ # <.>
    -v ./gitlab-data:/var/opt/gitlab \
    -e GITLAB_ROOT_PASSWORD=YourPassword \ #<.>
    docker.io/gitlab/gitlab-ce:latest
17349b87f81aa9eb7230f414923cf491c84a36a87d61057f8dc2f8f82c7ea60a
----
<.> We pass our new certs via volume mounts to Gitlab
<.> Our previously modified minimal config
<.> Let's be creative

TIP: This can also be done with the make target `pd-gitlab`.

Once the container is running Gitlab can be reached at following address:
<https://localhost:10443>

Great success, but unfortunately Gitlab alone is only half the deal.

==== Adding a runner

Setting up a runner which is able to spawn new containers inside Podman is a bit tricky and
requires to build a specially configured container first.

Luckily for us other [people struggled][] with the same idea and did the heavy lifting
for us:

[source,shell]
----
$ podman build -t $(RUNNER_IMAGE_NAME) -f runner/Containerfile \ # <.>
    --build-arg=GITLAB_URL=$(GITLAB_URL) \ # <.>
    --build-arg=REGISTRY_URL=$(REGISTRY_URL) \
    --build-arg=PODNAME=$(PODNAME)
----
<.> This relies on the [pipglr][] project
<.> This is an excerpt from the provided Makefile, so please consider the env variables properly set

TIP: This can also be done with the make target `pd-runner-podman-build`.

=== Registration of the runner

The current registration process requires us to register a new runner inside Gitlab first and
this can be done via menu:Admin[CICD > Runners > New instance runner] at:
<https://localhost:10443/admin/runners>

Once submitted the redirection is going to fail, since our host machine doesn't know the hostname
`gitlab`:

.Screenshot of the wrong address
image::gitlab_register_localhost.png[]

This can be bypassed by just replacing `gitlab` with `localhost` or with a quick edit of the
hosts file:

[source,shell]
----
$ grep 127 /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1     localhost
127.0.0.1     meanas
127.0.0.1     gitlab
----

Registration of the actual runner is bit a more involved, but remember the other people?
pipglr, the actual hero our story, comes prepared and brings some [container labels][] to execute
the registration commands.

I took the liberty to throw everything into a Makefile target, and we just call it directly this
time:

[source,shell]
----
$ TOKEN=glrt-t1_QnEnk-yx3sdgVT-DYt7i make pd-runner-podman
# This requires Podman >=4.1 <.>
#podman secret exists REGISTRATION_TOKEN && podman secret rm REGISTRATION_TOKEN || true
#podman secret exists config.toml && podman secret rm config.toml || true

----
<.> I really need to update this, meanwhile even my [Debian][] machine uses a decent version of Podman
<.> Yay!

The output looks promising, so let us verify our containers via Podman:

[source,shell]
----
$ podman ps -a --format 'table {{.ID}} {{.Image}} {{.Status}} {{.Names}}'
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                    STATUS                   NAMES
bfac4e6acb26  localhost/podman-pause:5.3.2-1737979078  Up 42 minutes            e91d11fdeb16-infra
cc6599fdf8db  docker.io/gitlab/gitlab-ce:latest        Up 42 minutes (healthy)  gitlab
8230fd623fc5  localhost/custom-pip-runner:latest       Up About a minute        pipglr
----

And there it is, our new runner in the list of Gitlab:

.Screenshot of our newly created runner
image::gitlab_runner.png[]

From here everything should be pretty much self-explanatory and there are loads of good articles
how to actually use Gitlab itself like:

- <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/tutorials/>
- <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/>

=== Bonus: Running with Dagger

Following the original idea of using Dagger, just another step of preparation is required.
Dagger uses another container inside the runner and adds a bit more compexity to the mix:

.Stacked containers
++++
{% plantuml %}
!theme unexist from {{ site.asciidoctor_attributes.plantumldir }}

skinparam linetype ortho
skinparam nodesep 20
skinparam ranksep 20

@startuml
stack "Gitlab Runner" {
    stack "Dagger" {
        stack "Builder" {
            file "Software"
        }
    }
}
@enduml
{% endplantuml %}
++++

The containers are nicely stacked, but this requires a specially grafted one for Dagger in order
for it to access files:

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM docker.io/golang:alpine

MAINTAINER Christoph Kappel <christoph@unexist.dev>

RUN apk add podman podman-docker curl fuse-overlayfs \
    && sed -i 's/#mount_program/mount_program/' /etc/containers/storage.conf \ #<.>
    && curl -sL --retry 3 https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.sh | BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
----
<.> This took me quite a while to figure out

=== Bonus: Caching via registry

With so many containers (1x gitlab + 1x runner + 1x builder) the limit of a free tier can be
quicky reached, and it is strongly advised to add some kind of caching layer.
Gitlab comes with its own [registry][] and can be used to cache all artifacts locally.

We already did the required configuration in our minimal config, so we just have to push the
containers and configure the registry.

[source,shell]
----
$ podman login -u root -p $(GITLAB_PASS) --tls-verify=false https://$(REGISTRY_URL) # <.>
$ podman push --tls-verify=false \Â¬
    $(BUILDER_IMAGE_NAME):latest $(REGISTRY_URL)/root/showcase-dagger-golang/$(BUILDER_IMAGE_NAME):latest
----
<.> Perfectly set-up environment for sure!

TIP: And finally this can be done with the make target `pd-gitlab-prepare-cache`.

== Conclusion

Gitlab is by itself a complex system and adding Podman and Dagger to the mix doesn't make it
easer at all, but probably increases the complexy tenfold.

*So what do we actually get?*

During my experiments with the trio I quickly ran into many problems and some of them were really
challenging.
Although I tried to address some of them in this blog post, to make it fellow readers easier to
gets started, the whole thing is still complicated.

My original goal was to benefit from the facts to have pipeline knowledge everywhere, since the
same pipelines are run locally and in the actual CICD and to be freed from the sales stuff
of Docker, but if I consider the cost of this small advantage...

Ultimately I made the decision to postpone every move in this direction for now.
