Discovering [domain-driven design][] has been an interesting journey for me.
Over the course of the last fives years I discovered more and more
different facets of it and I am still amazed how this model helps to understand
me to different old and new domain contexts.

This in this more theoretical blog post I want to talk about the different

== Inside and outside of bounded contexts

== Discovering old and new

== Conclusion
