I can probably cite myself from this blog, but writing documentation (not necessarily good
documentation, but any at all) is really difficult and keeping it up-to-date nigh on impossible.
To ease the pain, some clever people invented tools to write documentation-as-code, so docs can
co-exist next to the source and have a better chance of being touched, whenever something is
changed.

Based on my personal experience I can say the same is true for any kind of project decisions and
good luck finding any hint about them.
