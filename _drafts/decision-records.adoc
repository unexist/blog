I can probably cite myself from this blog, but writing documentation (not necessarily good
documentation mind you, but any at all) is really difficult and keeping it up-to-date nigh on
impossible.
To ease the pain, some clever people invented tools to write [documentation-as-code], so docs can
co-exist next to the source and have a better chance of being touched, whenever something is
changed.

Based on my personal experience I can say the same is true for any kind of project decisions and
good luck finding any hint about them - until I discovered records.

== Record types

During the course of this post we are going to do a quick recap of ADR mostly by pointing to
links ([DRY], you know?), introduce a new type for [technical debt] (aptly named [TDR]), have a
look at some examples some examples with adapted tooling and talk a bit about the power of the
idea, that isn't covered by the documents alone.

=== Architecture Decision Records

When I first heard about
{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2020-09-15-architecture-decisions %}[architecture decisions]
I was directly intrigued and blogged about, so there is no need to reiterate on this right now,
but in hindsight I can say it really took a while for me to actually see the real benefit of them.

It never came to my mind, but why should we stop here?

=== Technical Debts Records

[Michael Stal] pretty much got the gist of it and his suggestion is to handle technical debt in
the same lieu as architecture decisions.

- Documented as code
- Well placed next to the actual code or any other kind of source code repository
- With some mandatory fields and an open format as a guide rail.

In comparison with architecture decision records, the format of these new records (especially since
it is [Markdown]) looks a bit different, but we are going to cover that later on.

NOTE: I included the descriptions of the fields in the actual document, just because I cannot
explain the fields any better.

[source,markdown]

Technical Debt Record
====================

Title:
------
A concise name for the technical debt.

Author:
-------
The individual who identified or is documenting the debt.

Version:
--------
The version of the project or component where the debt exists.

Date:
-----
The date when the debt was identified or recorded.

State:
------
The current workflow stage of the technical debt (e.g., Identified, Analyzed, Approved, In Progress, Resolved, Closed, Rejected).

Relations:
----------
Links to other related TDRs to establish connections between different debt items.

Summary:
--------
A brief overview explaining the nature and significance of the technical debt.

Context:
--------
Detailed background information, including why the debt was incurred (e.g., time constraints, outdated technologies).

Impact:
-------
Technical Impact:
- How the debt affects system performance, scalability, maintainability, etc.

Business Impact:
- The repercussions on business operations, customer satisfaction, risk levels, etc.

Symptoms:
---------
Observable signs indicating the presence of technical debt (e.g., frequent bugs, slow performance).

Severity:
---------
The criticality level of the debt (Critical, High, Medium, Low).

Potential Risks:
----------------
Possible adverse outcomes if the debt remains unaddressed (e.g., security vulnerabilities, increased costs).

Proposed Solution:
-------------------
Recommended actions or strategies to resolve the debt.

Cost of Delay:
---------------
Consequences of postponing the resolution of the debt.

Effort to Resolve:
-------------------
Estimated resources, time, and effort required to address the debt.

Dependencies:
-------------
Other tasks, components, or external factors that the resolution of the debt depends on.

Additional Notes:
-----------------
Any other relevant information or considerations related to the debt.

He also provides [tooling] along with the definition, which is quite nice for a starter.

The format is really close to the one of the ADR, so I did the obvious migration and adapted it
to the format already used there.

The drawback of this is the previous tools cannot handle this new format and the adr-tools cannot
handle TDR yet.

== Record tools

During the course of the last few years I played with the original [adr-tools] based on the work
of its inventor [Nat Pryce] and added some missing features.
Like the pending [AsciiDoc] support, a simple database layer to speed up some of the generators
and added simple rss/atom feeds for easier aggregation.

This put me in a perfect position to adapt the tools even further and hack a new format into it
under a new umbrella.

TIP: I am still playing with the idea to port the shellscripts to [Rust] - does anyone fancy
`record-tools-rs`?

The following examples demonstrates how the record-tools can be used, starting with the basic steps
up to deploying rendered versions to a [Confluence] instance, since it always pays off to include
non-tech-savvy folks.

The record-tools include two examples, one of each kind to kickstart the decision to actually use
these formats and keep the intention of the original along with some shameful self advertisement:

== Comments
----

[NOTE]
--
It isn't strictly necessary to checkout the example, but if you want to play with the tooling:

[source,shell]
----
$ hg clone https://hg.unexist.dev/record-tools
$ # OR: git clone https://github.com/unexist/record-tools
...
$ cd record-tools/example
----
--

=== Create new records

Besides the name, the record-tools basically behave in the same manner like the original version
of the tools and for example a new TDB can be created like this:

[source,shell]
----
$ ../src/record-tdb new Usage of log4j # <.>
----
<.> This command creates a new record and opens it in your default $EDITOR

.Vim with a lovely default color scheme
image::tdb-log4j.png[]

If you consider the topic of this record there probably comes a lot to your mind what you would
like to add, but let us shorten this phase and accept the record as-is and press
[line-through]#save# btn:[:]+btn:[w].

=== Supersede old records

Sometimes decisions have to be revised (or superseded) and that couldn't be more true with
technical matters, once more information has been gathered and/or experience with the actual
decision could be gained.

[source,shell]
----
$ ../src/record-tdr new -s 2 Usage of zerolog # <.>
----
<.> Both are quite incompatible, but [zerolog] is always worth mentioning

=== Link records

Under the hood, _supersede_ just overwrites the status of the previous record with *supersded* and
applies links in both directions.
This can also be done manually with arbitrary links:

[source,shell]
----
$ ./src/record-tdr link 3 Amends 1 "Amended by" # <1>
----
<1> This command links record 3 to 1 long with the relationship of the link forwards and backwards

There isn't much direct visible effect besides the addition of the links to the
*Further Information* field, but more on this in the next section:

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Further Information

Any other relevant information or considerations related to the debt.

Supersedes link:0002-usage-of-log4j.adoc[2. Usage of Log4j]

Amends link:0001-technical-debt-decision.adoc[1. Record technical debt decisions]
----

=== Using generators

The tools include various generators that can be used to generate listings, graphs and even feeds.

==== Table of Contents (TOC)

The table of contents generates a nice overview of the known records and can additionally prepend and
append an intro and an outro, to allow further customization:

[source,shell]
----
$ ../src/record-tdr generate toc -i Intro -o Outro
= TDR records

Intro

* link:0001-technical-debt-decision.adoc[1. Record technical debt decisions]
* link:0002-usage-of-log4j.adoc[2. Usage of log4j]
* link:0003-usage-of-zerolog.adoc[3. Usage of zerolog]

Outro
----

==== Atom & RSS

These two generators should be pretty self-explanatory:

[source,shell]
----
$ ../src/record-tdr generate rss # <.>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<rss version="2.0">
  <channel>
    <title>List of all tdr records</title>
    <description>List of all created tdr records</description>
    <ttl>240</ttl>
    <lastBuildDate>2024-10-24 12:05</lastBuildDate>
    <generator>record-tools</generator>
    <webmaster>christoph@unexist.dev</webmaster>
<item><title>1. Record technical debt decisions</title><link>0001-technical-debt-decision.adoc</link><category>high</category><pubDate>2024-10-24</pubDate><description>Status: superseded</description></item> <item><title>2. Usage of log4j</title><link>0002-usage-of-log4j.adoc</link><category>low</category><pubDate>2024-10-22</pubDate><description>Status: superseded</description></item> <item><title>3. Usage of zerolog</title><link>0003-usage-of-zerolog.adoc</link><category>low</category><pubDate>2024-10-23</pubDate><description>Status: drafted</description></item>
  </channel>
</rss>
----
<.> Either use `rss` `atom` for the specific type

==== Digraph & Plantuml

Both generators create a graph based on [dot] - the sole difference is the plantuml version just
neatly wraps the output between `@startdot` and `@enddot`:

[source,shell]
----
$ ../src/record-tdr generate plantuml
... # <.>
----
<.> We omit the output here, because it looks way better directly rendered with [Plantuml] below

.Rendered diagram
++++
{% plantuml %}
!theme unexist from {{ site.asciidoctor_attributes.plantumldir }}

skinparam linetype ortho
skinparam nodesep 20
skinparam ranksep 20
@startdot
digraph tdr {
    node [shape=plaintext];
    bgcolor="transparent"

    subgraph {
        _1 [label="1. Record technical debt decisions"; URL="0001-technical-debt-decision.html", color="white", fontcolor="white"];
        _2 [label="2. Usage of log4j"; URL="0002-usage-of-log4j.html", color="white", fontcolor="white"];
        _1 -> _2 [style="dotted", weight=1, color="white", fontcolor="white"];
        _3 [label="3. Usage of zerolog"; URL="0003-usage-of-zerolog.html", fontcolor="white"];
        _2 -> _3 [style="dotted", weight=1, color="white", fontcolor="white"];
    }
    _2 -> _1 [label="Amends", weight=0, color="white", fontcolor="white"];
    _3 -> _1 [label="Supersedes", weight=0, color="white", fontcolor="white"];
}
@enddot
{% endplantuml %}
++++


Plantuml doesn't use the passed links, but when the graph is directly renderes as a a vector graphic
([svg]) it also includes links:

[source,shell]
----
$ ../src/record-tdr generate digraph | dot -Tsvg > graph.svg
----

==== Index

And index accumulates all known records, groups them based on different properties like
the severity and combines everything into a clickable page.

NOTE: This uses the tools quite heavily - or in other words is pretty slow.
Therefore it relies on the database to speed things up, which needs to be populated first.

[source,shell]
----
$ ../src/record-tdr generate database
$ ../src/record-tdr generate index
...

----

This page can be converted via [asciidoctor] and its various backends:

[source,shell]
----
$ ../src/record-adr generate database # <.>
$ ../src/record-adr generate index > _adr_autogen.adoc # <.>
$ asciidoctor -D architecture-decision-records src/site/asciidoc/architecture-decision-records/*.adoc # <.>
$ asciidoctor -D . -I architecture-decision-records /site/asciidoc/architecture-decision-records.adoc # <.>
$ asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-pdf -b pdf -D . src/site/asciidoc/architecture-decision-records.adoc # <.>
----
<.> Generate the database for both types
<.> Generate a neat index page for both types
<.> Render the actual documents now
<.> Optional step - just in case a PDF version is required

Once rendered the pages should look like this:

.Index page
image::index-page.png[]

.ADR page
image::adr-page.png[]

Another way of generating the page is via [Maven], which is quite handy since it is prerequisite
for the next step anyway.
Fortunately the example contains all required configuration and all that needs to be done is this:

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn -P generate-docs exec:exec generate-resources # <.>
----
<.> The [maven exec plugin] handles the database generation and index page part

TIP: There is a Makefile included in the example that provides convenience targets for the
commands like `make generate` and `make publish` which will come in handy for the next step.

=== Publish everything

And finally we want to publish our documents, to make them easy accessible for everyone.
There are many different options to pick from, but one of the easiest is to use the
[Confluence Publish] and put our documents to a [Confluence] instance of our choice.

Spinning up a confluence instance for this example is quite pointless without a license, so if
you really want to see it in action there is some config required in the `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- Confluence config -->
<!-- NOTE: Be careful with the ancestorID, everything will be overwritten -->
<confluence.url>${env.CONFLUENCE_URL}</confluence.url> <!--.-->
<confluence.publishingStrategy>APPEND_TO_ANCESTOR</confluence.publishingStrategy>

<!-- Provide these values from env; don't commit them! -->
<confluence.spaceKey>${env.CONFLUENCE_SPACE}</confluence.spaceKey> <!--.-->
<confluence.ancestorId>${env.CONFLUENCE_ANCESTOR}</confluence.ancestorId> <!--.-->
<confluence.publisherUserName>${env.CONFLUENCE_USER}</confluence.publisherUserName>
<confluence.publisherPassword>${env.CONFLUENCE_TOKEN}</confluence.publisherPassword>
----
<.> The configuration can either passed by environment variables or be hardcoded - this is up to you
<.> This is normally the two letter abbreviation of the space, which can be found within the
space settings
<.> And finally we also need the ancestor id to append our records to. Problems to find it? Just
open the page settings and have a look at the address bar of your browser.

And once everything is set up correctly just fire up following:

[source,shell]
----
$ CONFLUENCE_USER=USER_NAME CONFLUENCE_TOKEN=USER_TOKEN mvn -P generate-docs-and-publish exec:exec generate-resources
----

== Records and culture

Aside from the documentation aspect and way to have these documents kind of guided to the fixed
chapter layout, we haven't spoken of the real power of this yet.

Records shouldn't be drafted by single persons and allow people of the teams to contribute to and
suggest changes of the overall architecture in the case of ADR and point to critical problems
within TDR.

This can be a culture change of the involved teams, since it allows a more active participation
in the process and also provides an opportunity to devise improvements in [PoC] or simple showcases.
Naturally this is best done in pairs or more, but this depends on the topic and preferences of the
participants.

And there are many more ways for active collaboration like [Writer's Workshops], which work
splendidly with this approach.
