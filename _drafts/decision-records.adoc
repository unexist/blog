I can probably cite myself from this blog, but writing documentation (not necessarily good
documentation, but any at all) is really difficult and keeping it up-to-date nigh on impossible.
To ease the pain, some clever people invented tools to write [documentation-as-code], so docs can
co-exist next to the source and have a better chance of being touched, whenever something is
changed.

Based on my personal experience I can say the same is true for any kind of project decisions and
good luck finding any hint about them.

When I first heard about
{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2020-09-15-architecture-decisions %}[architecture decisions] I was
directly
intrigued, but it took a while for me to actually see the real benefit of them.

It never came to my mind, but why should we stop here?

== Technical Debts Records

[Michael Stal] pretty much got the gist of it and his suggestion is to handle [technical debts] in
the same lieu as architecture decisions.
Documented as code, well placed next to the actual code or any other kind of source code
repository with some mandatory fields and an open format as a guide rail.

In comparison with architecture decision records, the format of these new records looks a bit
different, but we are going to cover that later on.

Technical Debt Record
====================

Title:
------
A concise name for the technical debt.

Author:
-------
The individual who identified or is documenting the debt.

Version:
--------
The version of the project or component where the debt exists.

Date:
-----
The date when the debt was identified or recorded.

State:
------
The current workflow stage of the technical debt (e.g., Identified, Analyzed, Approved, In Progress, Resolved, Closed, Rejected).

Relations:
----------
Links to other related TDRs to establish connections between different debt items.

Summary:
--------
A brief overview explaining the nature and significance of the technical debt.

Context:
--------
Detailed background information, including why the debt was incurred (e.g., time constraints, outdated technologies).

Impact:
-------
Technical Impact:
- How the debt affects system performance, scalability, maintainability, etc.

Business Impact:
- The repercussions on business operations, customer satisfaction, risk levels, etc.

Symptoms:
---------
Observable signs indicating the presence of technical debt (e.g., frequent bugs, slow performance).

Severity:
---------
The criticality level of the debt (Critical, High, Medium, Low).

Potential Risks:
----------------
Possible adverse outcomes if the debt remains unaddressed (e.g., security vulnerabilities, increased costs).

Proposed Solution:
-------------------
Recommended actions or strategies to resolve the debt.

Cost of Delay:
---------------
Consequences of postponing the resolution of the debt.

Effort to Resolve:
-------------------
Estimated resources, time, and effort required to address the debt.

Dependencies:
-------------
Other tasks, components, or external factors that the resolution of the debt depends on.

Additional Notes:
-----------------
Any other relevant information or considerations related to the debt.
