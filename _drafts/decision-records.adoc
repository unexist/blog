I can probably cite myself from this blog, but writing documentation (not necessarily good
documentation mind you, but any at all) is really difficult and keeping it up-to-date nigh on
impossible.
To ease the pain, some clever people invented tools to write [documentation-as-code], so docs can
co-exist next to the source and have a better chance of being touched, whenever something is
changed.

Based on my personal experience I can say the same is true for any kind of project decisions and
good luck finding any hint about them - until I discovered records.

== Record types

During the course of this post we are going to do a quick recap of ADR mostly by pointing to
links ([DRY], you know?), introduce a new type for [technical debt] (aptly named [TDR]), have a
look at some examples some examples with adapted tooling and talk a bit about the power of the
idea, that isn't covered by the documents alone.

=== Architecture Decision Records

When I first heard about
{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2020-09-15-architecture-decisions %}[architecture decisions]
I was directly intrigued and blogged about, so there is no need to reiterate on this right now,
but in hindsight I can say it really took a while for me to actually see the real benefit of them.

It never came to my mind, but why should we stop here?

=== Technical Debts Records

[Michael Stal] pretty much got the gist of it and his suggestion is to handle technical debt in
the same lieu as architecture decisions.

- Documented as code
- Well placed next to the actual code or any other kind of source code repository
- With some mandatory fields and an open format as a guide rail.

In comparison with architecture decision records, the format of these new records (especially since
it is [Markdown]) looks a bit different, but we are going to cover that later on.

NOTE: I included the descriptions of the fields in the actual document, just because I cannot
explain the fields any better.

Technical Debt Record
====================

Title:
------
A concise name for the technical debt.

Author:
-------
The individual who identified or is documenting the debt.

Version:
--------
The version of the project or component where the debt exists.

Date:
-----
The date when the debt was identified or recorded.

State:
------
The current workflow stage of the technical debt (e.g., Identified, Analyzed, Approved, In Progress, Resolved, Closed, Rejected).

Relations:
----------
Links to other related TDRs to establish connections between different debt items.

Summary:
--------
A brief overview explaining the nature and significance of the technical debt.

Context:
--------
Detailed background information, including why the debt was incurred (e.g., time constraints, outdated technologies).

Impact:
-------
Technical Impact:
- How the debt affects system performance, scalability, maintainability, etc.

Business Impact:
- The repercussions on business operations, customer satisfaction, risk levels, etc.

Symptoms:
---------
Observable signs indicating the presence of technical debt (e.g., frequent bugs, slow performance).

Severity:
---------
The criticality level of the debt (Critical, High, Medium, Low).

Potential Risks:
----------------
Possible adverse outcomes if the debt remains unaddressed (e.g., security vulnerabilities, increased costs).

Proposed Solution:
-------------------
Recommended actions or strategies to resolve the debt.

Cost of Delay:
---------------
Consequences of postponing the resolution of the debt.

Effort to Resolve:
-------------------
Estimated resources, time, and effort required to address the debt.

Dependencies:
-------------
Other tasks, components, or external factors that the resolution of the debt depends on.

Additional Notes:
-----------------
Any other relevant information or considerations related to the debt.

He also provides [tooling] along with the definition, which is quite nice for a starter.

The format is really close to the one of the ADR, so I did the obvious migration and adapted it
to the format already used there.

The drawback of this is the previous tools cannot handle this new format and the adr-tools cannot
handle TDR yet.

== Record tools

During the course of the last few years I played with the original [adr-tools] based on the work
of its inventor [Nat Pryce] and added some missing features.
Like the pending [AsciiDoc] support, a simple database layer to speed up some of the generators
and added simple rss/atom feeds for easier aggregation.

This put me in a perfect position to adapt the tools even further and hack a new format into it
under a new umbrella.

TIP: I am still playing with the idea to port the shellscripts to [Rust] - does anyone fancy
`record-tools-rs`?

=== Examples

The following examples demonstrates how the record-tools can be used, starting with the basic steps
up to deploying rendered versions to a [Confluence] instance, since it always pays off to include
non-tech-savvy folks.

The record-tools include two examples, one of each kind to kickstart the decision to actually use
these formats and keep the thought of the original:

NOTE: *Status types:* drafted | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded +

== Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

== Proposed Solution

Architecture Decision Records as {1}[summarised by Christoph] might help us as a format.

== Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records.

== Consequences

None foreseeable.

==== Create new records

Besides the name, the record-tools basically behave in the same manner like the original version
of the tools and for example a new TDB can be created like this:

[source,shell]
----
$ ../src/record-tdb new Usage of log4j # <1>
----
<1> This command create a new record and opens it in your default $EDITOR

image::tdb-log4j.png[]

If you consider the name there comes probably a lot to your mind what you would like to add,
but let us shorten this phase and accept the record as-is and [line-through]#press save# press
btn:[:]+btn:[w].

==== Supersede old records

Sometimes decisions have to be revised and that couldn't be more true with technical decisions,
once we've gathered more information and/or gained experience with out decision.

[source,shell]
----
$ ../src/record-tdr new -s 2 Usage of zerolog # <1>
----
<1> Let us mix languages here, but [zerolog] is always worth mentioning

==== Link records

Under the hood, supersede just overwrites the status of the previous record and applies links in
both directions and obviously this can also be done directly:

[source,shell]
----
$ ./src/record-tdr link 3 Amends 1 "Amended by" # <1>
----
<1> This command links record 3 to 1 long with the relationship of the link forwards and backwards

==== Generate output

There are several options from here on:

- Calling the [AsciiDoc CLI] manually, which is perfectly capable of generating all of the documents
- Relying on [Maven], which is used anyway with the [Confluence Publisher] plugin


Since the [Makefile] already packages the commands necessary for Maven, so we are going to do it
based on the good ol' CLI:

[source,shell]
----
$ hg clone https://hg.unexist.dev/record-tools # <1>
...
$ cd record-tools/example
$ ../src/record-adr generate database # <2>
$ ../src/record-adr generate index > _adr_autogen.adoc # <3>
$ asciidoctor -D architecture-decision-records src/site/asciidoc/architecture-decision-records/*.adoc # <4>
$ asciidoctor -D . -I architecture-decision-records /site/asciidoc/architecture-decision-records.adoc # <3>
$ asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-pdf -b pdf -D . src/site/asciidoc/architecture-decision-records.adoc # <5>
----
<1> OR: git clone <https://github.com/unexist/record-tools>
<2> Generate the database for both types
<3> Generate a neat index page for both types
<4> Render the actual documents now
<5> Optional step - just in case a PDF version is required

Once rendered the pages should look like this:

.Index page
image::index-page.png[]

.ADR page
image::adr-page.png[]

NOTE: The same can be achieved with `make generate`.
