It has been roughly two years since my last post regarding my experience with the state of AI
({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2023-04-28-coding-with-ai %}[Coding with AI]) and I think it is about
time to talk about this again.

But in contrast to the previous post, this time I don't want to dwell on specific products and
tools, but to explain why I think we should pay close attention to the development and why this
topic is generally such a mixed bag to me.

Enough chit-chat, let us begin.

== Omnipresence in media

When I look back at the last two years I can safely say the whole think got even more traction, as
we left the early adopting phase.
AI has entered the mainstream and almost everything gets
AI support and if it isn't feasible we throw {mcp}[MCP] with all it's {mcprcp}[flaws] into the fold.

Strictly speaking everything went according to plan:

== Asking the right questions

== Impact on society

So what happened during these two years?
There has been lots of iterations on language models, loads of new tools

Even more than two years ago AI is omnipresent in almost every type of media I consume

The whole AI topic is a kind of mixed bag to me
