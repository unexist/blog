It has been roughly two years since my last post regarding my experience with the state of AI
({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2023-04-28-coding-with-ai %}[Coding with AI]) and I think it is about
time to talk about this again.

But in contrast to the previous post, this time I don't want to dwell on specific products and
tools, but to explain why I think we should pay close attention to the development and why this
topic is generally such a mixed bag to me.

Enough chit-chat, let us begin.

== Omnipresence in media

When I look back at the last two years I can safely say the whole thing got even more traction, as
we've left the early adopting phase.

- AI has entered the mainstream and almost everything gets AI support and if it isn't directly
feasible we throw {mcp}[MCP] with all it's {mcprcp}[flaws] into the fold.
- There is an abundance of new tools and new companies sprout like {popup}[pop-up stores] with huge
amounts of venture capital and tax money to burn.
- The expectations are at an all-time high and my media bubbles spill over with new innovative ideas
and applications of AI-technology like trying to replace general {laborai}[human labor] and even
highly specific ones like {nurseai}[nurses in healthcare].
- {billgates}[AI promises to reduce our daily working time].

So in hindsight everything went according to plan from 2023:

== Asking the right questions

During the two years I've read quite a few articles about AI and related stuff including the books
{tamingsiliconvalley}[Taming Silicon Valley] <<tamingsiliconvalley>> and the entertaining
{theaicon}[The AI Con] <<theaicon>> and begin to wonder what kind of problems does AI really try to
address?

If I look at the business side I'd say the overall themes are to *increase productivityfootnote:[Read:
getting faster]* like reducing tiresome and/or manual labor and probably fear of missing a
competitive advantage.
And on the personal side I mostly see quality-of-life improvements like easy *access to information*
with the help of the natural interfaces like {chatgpt}[ChatGPT]footnote:[Or just "Chatty" as I've learned recently]
and generational parts to create memes and reels more easily.

These aren't the only applications mind you, but they are sufficient for
twofootnote:[One short from looking like an AI-written text — https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ch4a6ffPZY!]
points I'd like to make next.

=== Increase productivity

Increasing productivity and reducing work time with technology isn't strictly speaking a new idea,
[line-through]#blue collar# industrial workers faced this already during the mid-19th century
during the {industrialage}[industrial age], but for the first time [line-through]#white collar#
knowledge workers are impacted, and they aren't backed by any
{labourmovement}[labour union to fight back].

Back then there were lots of riots and protests, so the workforce probably wasn't all happy with
the outcome, but we aren't there *yet*, so let us focus on the promise of our improved
work-life-balance.
Interestingly during that time a strange phenomenon could be observed:

[quote,David Graeber,https://davidgraeber.org/articles/on-the-phenomenon-of-bullshit-jobs-a-work-rant]
But rather than allowing a massive reduction of working hours to free the world’s population to
pursue their own projects, pleasures, visions, and ideas, we have seen the ballooning of not even
so much of the ‘service’ sector as of the administrative sector, up to and including the creation
of whole new industries like financial services or telemarketing, or the unprecedented expansion of
sectors like corporate law, academic and health administration, human resources, and public
relations. And these numbers do not even reflect on all those people whose job is to provide
administrative, technical, or security support for these industries, or for that matter the whole
host of ancillary industries (dog-washers, all-night pizza delivery) that only exist because
everyone else is spending so much of their time working in all the other ones.
These are what I propose to call ‘*bullshit jobsfootnote:[Emphasis is mine]*’.

I really enjoy the term *bullshit jobs* here, but in my opinion especially all these ancillary
industries can also be explained by increase of wealthfootnote:[Read: Capitalism?] and not just by
lack of time of the populace.

The more concerning part to me is what can we do with our skilled workforce, that still has the
need to earn money for a living, but their field of work has been replaced with automatons?

[quote,David Graeber,https://davidgraeber.org/articles/on-the-phenomenon-of-bullshit-jobs-a-work-rant]
Hell is a collection of individuals who are spending the bulk of their time working on a task they
don't like and are not especially good at. Say they were hired because they were excellent
cabinet-makers, and then discover they are expected to spend a great deal of their time frying fish.

Another issue I see with increasing productivity is the orientation towards through- or rather
output in information related topics.
Viewed from the business side increasing quantity makes total sense to me, this is what the business
has been created for in the first place.



=== Access to information

[quote,Ben Morris,https://www.ben-morris.com/ai-and-the-creeping-enshittification-of-work]
After all, who are you writing for? Do you care if anybody reads it and how they respond to it?
How can you expect anybody to relate to a piece of writing if it was generated by an AI model?
If you can’t be bothered to write the entire article, you can’t really expect anybody else to be
bothered to read it.

== Impact on society

== Conclusion

I am just tired of AI - it is just everywhere and I don't see any real benefit for me.
