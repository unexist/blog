It has been roughly two years since my last post regarding my experience with the state of AI
({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2023-04-28-coding-with-ai %}[Coding with AI]) and I think it is about
time to talk about this again.

But in contrast to the previous post, this time I don't want to dwell on specific products and
tools, but to explain why I think we should pay close attention to the development and why this
topic is generally such a mixed bag to me.

Enough chit-chat, let us begin.

== Omnipresence in media

When I look back at the last two years I can safely say the whole thing got even more traction, as
we've left the early adopting phase.

- AI has entered the mainstream and almost everything gets AI support and if it isn't directly
feasible we throw {mcp}[MCP] with all it's {mcprcp}[flaws] into the fold.
- There is an abundance of new tools, as it should be for new technology, and new companies sprout
like {popup}[pop-up stores] with huge amounts of venture capital and tax money to burn.
- The expectations are at an all-time high and the media overflows with new innovative ideas and
applications of AI-technology like replacing {nurseai}[nurses with AI in healthcare] or how
companies generally try to replace {laborai}[human labor].
- We are back to the promise from the industrial age: Once AI is everywhere we have more free time
and can spend it on life and art.

Strictly speaking everything went according to plan from 2023:

== Asking the right questions

During the two years I've read quite a few articles about AI and related stuff including the books
{tamingsiliconvalley}[Taming Silicon Valley] <<tamingsiliconvalley>> and the entertaining
{theaicon}[The AI Con] <<theaicon>> and begin to wonder what kind of problems does AI really try to
address and solve?

If I look at the business side I'd say the overall theme is to *increase productivityfootnote:[read:
getting faster]* and to reduce tiresome  and/or manual labor.
And on the personal side I mostly see quality-of-life improvements like easier *access to information*
with the help of the natural interface of {chatgpt}[ChatGPT]footnote:[or just "Chatty" I learned recently]
and the generational parts to create memes and reels more easily.

These aren't the only applications out there mind you, but they are sufficient for two points I'd
like to make next.

=== Increase productivity

Increasing productivity with technology is no new idea, [line-through]#blue collar# industrial
workers faced this already some during the mid-19th century during the
{industrialage}[industrial age], but interestingly this time [line-through]#white collar# knowledge
workers are impacted, and they aren't backed by any {labourmovement}[labour union to fight back].

During that time a strange phenomenon occurred:

[quote,David Graeber,https://davidgraeber.org/articles/on-the-phenomenon-of-bullshit-jobs-a-work-rant]
But rather than allowing a massive reduction of working hours to free the world’s population to
pursue their own projects, pleasures, visions, and ideas, we have seen the ballooning of not even
so much of the ‘service’ sector as of the administrative sector, up to and including the creation
of whole new industries like financial services or telemarketing, or the unprecedented expansion of
sectors like corporate law, academic and health administration, human resources, and public
relations. And these numbers do not even reflect on all those people whose job is to provide
administrative, technical, or security support for these industries, or for that matter the whole
host of ancillary industries (dog-washers, all-night pizza delivery) that only exist because
everyone else is spending so much of their time working in all the other ones.
These are what I propose to call ‘*bullshit jobs:footnote:[Emphasis is mine]*’.

If we just ignore the administrative aspects (which are moderns problems in its own) I daresay some
of the mentioned jobs are caused due to the general increase and distribution of wealth, but is
still probably related.





[quote,Ben Morris,https://www.ben-morris.com/ai-and-the-creeping-enshittification-of-work]
After all, who are you writing for? Do you care if anybody reads it and how they respond to it?
How can you expect anybody to relate to a piece of writing if it was generated by an AI model?
If you can’t be bothered to write the entire article, you can’t really expect anybody else to be
bothered to read it.


=== Access to information


== Impact on society

== Conclusion

I am just tired of AI - it is just everywhere and I don't see any real benefit for me.
