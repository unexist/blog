It has been roughly two years since my last post regarding my experience with the state of AI
({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2023-04-28-coding-with-ai %}[Coding with AI]) and I think it is about
time to talk about this again.

But in contrast to the previous post, this time I don't want to dwell on specific products and
tools, but to explain why I think we should pay close attention to the development and why this
topic is generally such a mixed bag to me.

Enough chit-chat, let us begin.

== Omnipresence in media

When I look back at the last two years I can safely say the whole thing got even more traction, as
we've left the early adopting phase.

- AI has entered the mainstream and almost everything gets AI support and if it isn't directly
feasible we throw {mcp}[MCP] with all it's {mcprcp}[flaws] into the fold.
- There is an abundance of new tools, as it should be for new technology, and new companies sprout
like {popup}[pop-up stores] with huge amounts of venture capital and tax money to burn.
- The expectations are at an all-time high and the media overflows with new innovative ideas and
applications of AI-technology like replacing {nurseai}[nurses with AI in healthcare] or how
companies generally try to replace {laborai}[human labor].

Strictly speaking everything went according to plan from 2023:

== Asking the right questions

I've read many articles about AI and related stuff including the books
{tamingsiliconvalley}[Taming Silicon Valley] <<tamingsiliconvalley>> and the entertaining one
{theaicon}[The AI Con] <<theaicon>> and wonder what kind of problems does AI really try to address
and solve?

If you look at the business side I'd say the overall theme is to increase productivityfootnote:[read:
getting faster] and to reduce manual and tiresome labor and on the personal side mostly
quality-of-life improvements with the likes of
{chatgpt}[ChatGPT]footnote:[or just "Chatty" I learned recently] and the stuff I'd loosely
collect under the umbrella of movie and image generation.

These aren't the only tasks that , but the few named examples generally
match the category "gettings things done" without a benefit of a learning how the desired result
can be archived without them.
