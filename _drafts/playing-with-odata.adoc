Last year I briefly dived into the world of [SAP][] and its new [Business Technology Platform][]
(BTP) and tried to make sense of everything there.
During that time I discovered [OData][] or Open Data protocol is the communication protocol by
choice and wondered why it is favored over traditional [REST][].

So during the course of this blog post we are going to have a look at the main differences of
both and also at a basic implementation with the help of the Apache project [Olingo][] and
[Quarkus][].

== What is OData

=== Metadata

=== Query, Filter, Expand

== Conclusion
