There are many qualities modern software [line-through]#has to# *should* address - when done properly - by a
professional.
Among the long list of {ilities}[-ilities], there are some boring and pretty self-explanatory ones like
{maintainability}[maintainability], some dogmatic ones like {correctness}[correctness]footnote:[Correctnessily?], but
also other more interesting ones, like {extensibility}[extensibility].

How a certain quality is best achieved depends on a plethora of things, but overall the targeted ones should match the
requirements and the budget to burn.
Going into detail of even the essential qualities is something with lists like {wikipedia}[Wikipedia], we are far
better off to stick to a funny one for the remainder of this post.

According to {wikipedia}[Wikipedia] extensibility revolves around future growth and proper design, but also mentions
scripting languages in the black box part and this is where we jump in.
So feel free to accompany me here while I delve a bit in my {FOSS}[FOSS]-history and lay out how different approaches
and scripting languages can be used to create entry points into your software.

== Barebone

Unbeknownst to my past self, my first experience with extensibility has been in 2004 when I started my long journey
with {xlib}[Xlib] and a lightweight system monitor called {deskbar}[deskbar].
The goal was to print system information like cpu load, battery usage etc. directly onto the root window of the X
session.
There were plenty of alternatives like {gkrellm}[GKrellM] readily available, but who likes floating windows in a
tiling set?

I would have loved to show some screenshots of it in action here, but unfortunately after messing with the beloved
{autotools}[Autotools] and trying to compile old {clang}[C]-code with a modern compiler this is as far as I
gotfootnote:[..followed by two kilometres of error trace I am not in the mood to fix right now]:

[source,shell]

deskbar 0.1
-----------------
Build with ZLIB support.......: yes
Build with PNG support........: yes

Plugins:
Common Plugins................: Clock CPU Date
Battery Plugin................: no
XMMS Plugin...................: no // <.>
BMP Plugin....................: no // <.>
Debug Plugin..................: no

The binary will be installed in /usr/local/bin,
the lib in /usr/local/lib and the plugins
in /usr/local/lib/deskbar.

Try make now, good luck!
----
<.> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMMS[X Multimedia System (XMMS)]
<.> I can only guess - the plugin is just an empty stub that returns `NULL`

Still, this output clearly shows there has been a plugin system with conditional compilation and bases solely on
linker magic and the help of {dlopen}[dlopen] and {dlsym}[dlsym]:

When a binary is put together it may consist of static libraries which are directly included


{sharedobj}[Shared objects] or shared libraries can be loaded per runtime with the help of



In order to load

Back then everything was written in
the only real thing is to accept contribution in the form of even more C.
Since integration and compiling the whole project from scratch everytime is quite annoying, you design your own plugin

.{deskbar}[Deskbar]/deskbar/plug.c:97
[source,c]
----
DbPlugElement *element = NULL;

element = (DbPlugElement *) malloc (sizeof (DbPlugElement));

snprintf (buf, sizeof (buf), "%s/%s.so", PLUGIN_DIR, file);

element->handle = dlopen (buf, RTLD_LAZY); // <.>

if ((err = dlerror ())) // <.>
        {
                db_log_err ("Cannot load plugin `%s'\n", file);
                db_log_debug ("dlopen (): %s\n", err);

                free (element);

                return;
        }

/* Get entrypoint and call it */
entrypoint      = dlsym (element->handle, "db_plug_init"); // <.>
element->data   = (*entrypoint) (); // <.>
----
<.> Load a named {sharedobj}[shared object] from path with {dlopen}[dlopen]
<.> There is apparently a third buddy, rarely mentioned at all
<.> Find the address of a named entrypoint with {dlsym}[dlsym]
<.> Execute the entrypoint for profit


This opens some new ways of enriching your software and from your perspective it bases on an understandable and
approachable API.

.{deskbar}[Deskbar]/plugins/battery.c:58+107
[source,c]

void
battery_update (void) // <.>
{
        int capacity    = 0,
        percent         = 0;

        char buf[100], state[20];

        /* Get battery info */
        if (!fd1)
                {
                        snprintf (buf, sizeof (buf), "/proc/acpi/battery/BAT%d/state", bat_slot);

                        fd1 = fopen (buf, "r");

                        memset (buf, 0, sizeof (buf));
                }
        else
            fseek (fd1, 0, SEEK_SET);
...

static DbPlug plugin =
{
        "Battery",       /* Plugin name */
        battery_create,  /* Plugin create function */
        battery_update,  /* Plugin update function */
        battery_destroy, /* Plugin destroy function */

        &data,           /* Plugin data */
        NULL,            /* Plugin format */

        3600             /* Plugin update interval */
};

DbPlug *
db_plug_init (void)
{
        plug = &plugin; // <.>

        return (&plugin);
}
----
<.> This is just an excerpt, but the plugin relies on the {acpi}[ACPI] interface to extract the battery stats
<.> Here we just pass a struct with function pointers to call the plugin

The learning curve is steep, and you quickly realize allowing custom code offers lots of freedom to enhance the
software, but like so often with double-edged sword, there is an.. ehm another sharp edge?
{segfault}[Segmentation faults], the bane of software engineering, don't make halt inside plugins like they should, but
they wipe the board and kill the entire application!

Shocked as you are, you grab your dusty C-bible and look for ways to mitigate this, since it goes without question you
don't want to violate the famous saying:

[quote,Linus Torvals,https://www.shutupmauro.com/]
[line-through]#Mauro, SHUT THE FUCK UP!# +
WE DO NOT BREAK USERSPACE!

Taking this advice by heart, you basically dive into the book and read on.

image::few_hours_later.png[]

Right there, in the forbidden section of the book, you stumble upon another pair of
buddies - `setjmp` and `longjmp`:

.{deskbar}[Deskbar]/deskbar/plug.c:32
[source,c]
----
if (setjmp (env) == 0) // <.>
        plugfunc ();
else
        {
                db_log_mesg ("Ayyyee! Segmentation fault in plugin %s!\n",
                                                                 element->data->name); // <.>
                db_log_debug ("Call to %s () failed\n", name);
                db_plug_unload (element);

                return (1);
        }
----
<.> {setjmp}[setjmp] is a bit arcane magic, but essentially sets a return markerfootnote:[Kind of a {goto}[goto label]] on the stack
<.> Well, different times back then..

.{deskbar}[Deskbar]/deskbar/sig.c:35
[source,c]
----
case SIGSEGV:
        longjmp (env, 1); // <.>

        db_log_debug ("Something went wrong! Segmentation fault!\n");
        db_sig_destroy ();

        abort ();
break;
----
<.> Once a segmentation fault occurs, unwind the stack with {longjmp}[longjmp] until the previous marker has been found
(if any) and try again

Once in place you feel content with the solution, reflect shortly on the impacts and release it to the wild.

|===
| Ease of use | Richness of API | Language agnostic | Error handling

| Requires compilation and linking
| Language + host provided
| No, requires plugins to be in Cfootnote:[Technically everything that can be linked, so other languages might actually be possible here]
| Arcane - requires stack unwinding

== Scripting languages

Still happy with the success of the previous project, you think the previous great thing is lacking in design and
ambition and you devise something new.
