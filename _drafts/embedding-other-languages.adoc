Coming up with a new software project is always a fun thing.
You start from a mere idea, like some quality-of-life thing as replacement for a piece of software that drives you nuts
or even something, that addresses a real problem, you tinker with it, play with it and move on.
And *if* everything goes really well you might end up with something quite usable.

This is by itself a great milestone, but wouldn't it be really great, if other people can also enjoy it?
Living in a {FOSS}[FOSS] world, publishing your code on
{Github}[Github]footnote:[Or {Codeberg}[Codeberg], if you don't want to contribute to AI] is just a stone throw away.
This directly acts as a fine distribution channel, since you can just annouce it on pages like
{hackernews}[Hacker News] and call it a day.

Fast forward, your software is quite mature and among all the {ilities}[-ilities] you've already addressed since you
are a professional, *extensibility* hasn't been high up on your list and you kind of lack behind user requests.

What about your software supports user contributed code?
