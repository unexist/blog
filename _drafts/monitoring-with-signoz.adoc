Finding good examples for monitoring or rather [observability] is really difficult, because either they are heavily
contrived like the one I've used in my last blogpost about <Logging vs Tracing> and/or there wasn't the singular
impact on production, that made you wish for better monitoring yet and it is difficult to understand the merit.

Still, nobody got fired from [line-through]#buying IBM# ramping up monitoring, so let us - for the course of this
post - put our [EFK][] stack along with [jaeger]  away and get started with something fancy new.

== What is SigNoz?

If you are like me and you haven't heard SigNoz before the first and foremost questions are probably what is SigNoz
and why not [insert random other solution here] to the same problem.

From a marketing perspective the key selling point for me probably was the headline on the frontpage:

[quote,https://signoz.io]
OpenTelemetry-Native Logs, Metrics and Traces in a single pane

Without further knowing, this was exactly what I need:

- FOSS
- Single solution to the three pillars
- Nice and complete package

That sounds rather good, but time to put my technical hat and check the brief.
Thankfully they provide an architecture overview as well and this quickly caught my eye:

++++
{% plantuml %}
!theme unexist from {{ site.asciidoctor_attributes.plantumldir }}

skinparam linetype ortho
skinparam nodesep 20
skinparam ranksep 20

rectangle "App (1))" as app
rectangle "Otel Collector (2)" as otel

card "SigNoz (3)" as signoz {
    rectangle "SigNoz Otel Collector" as sigotel
    database "Clickhouse" as clickhouse
    rectangle "Query Service" as query
    rectangle "Alert Manager" as alert
    rectangle "Frontend" as fe
}

app -[hidden]d-> otel

app -r-> sigotel
otel -l-> sigotel

sigotel --> clickhouse
clickhouse --> query
query <--> alert
query <-> fe
{% endplantuml %}
