It has been a while since my last excursion into the world of monitoring or rather
[observability][] and meanwhile I'd say my own understanding of the whole idea has improved.

So for the course of this blog post we put the [EFK][] stack along with [jaeger] from my previous
post away and create an easier, but more complete example with Golang and [SigNoz][].

Ready? Go!
