Finding good reasoning to explore different options for monitoring or better [observability] is difficult.
Either there wasn't the singular impact on production yet, that made you lust for better monitoring and/or it is
difficult to understand the merit and invest of time.

And even when you make the decision to dive into it, a good advise is probably not to start on production, but with
a simple example.
Simple examples on the other hand rarely show the real powers, so it usually ends in heavily contrived ones like
the one I've used in my last blogpost about
{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2022-02-18-logging-vs-tracing %}[Logging vs Tracing].

Still, nobody got fired from [line-through]#buying IBM# ramping up monitoring, so let us - for the course of this
post - put our [EFK][] stack and friends aside and get started with something shiny new.

== What is SigNoz?

If you are like me and you haven't heard the name [SigNoz][] before the first and foremost questions are probably
what is SigNoz and why not one of these solutions `insert random product here`.

From a marketing perspective the key selling point for me probably and honestly was the headline on the
frontpage:

[quote,https://signoz.io]
OpenTelemetry-Native Logs, Metrics and Traces in a single pane

Without knowing prior to that, this was exactly what I need, so well done marketing:

. [FOSS][]
. Single solution to address the [three pillars][]
. Nice and complete package

That sounds rather too good, but time to put my wizard hat and to check the brief.
Before even messing with [docker-compose][] they thankfully provide an architecture overview and this looks like
they hold their part of the deal:

++++
{% plantuml %}
!theme unexist from {{ site.asciidoctor_attributes.plantumldir }}

skinparam linetype ortho
skinparam nodesep 20
skinparam ranksep 20

rectangle "App (1))" as app
rectangle "Otel Collector (2)" as otel

card "SigNoz" as signoz {
    rectangle "SigNoz Otel Collector (3)" as sigotel
    database "Clickhouse (4)" as clickhouse
    rectangle "Query Service (5)" as query
    rectangle "Alert Manager (6)" as alert
    rectangle "Frontend (7)" as fe
}

app -[hidden]d-> otel

app -r-> sigotel
otel -l-> sigotel

sigotel --> clickhouse
clickhouse --> query
query <--> alert
query <-> fe
{% endplantuml %}
++++
<1> Apps can directly send data to SigNoz
<2> [Otel collectors][] can transmit data as well
<3> Internally another collector provides the endpoints to receive data
<4> Columnar storage? Though I haven't heared of [Clickhouse][] either before
<5> Some abstraction to query the actual data
<6> [Alert Manager][] keeps tracks and handles all the various alerts - glad they haven't reinvented the wheel
<7> And the shiny bit we've spoken of before
