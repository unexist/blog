Finding good examples for monitoring or rather [observability] is really difficult, because either they are heavily
contrived like the one I've used in my last blogpost about <Logging vs Tracing> and/or there wasn't the singular
impact on production, that made you wish for better monitoring yet and it is difficult to understand the merit.

Still, nobody got fired from [line-through]#buying IBM# ramping up monitoring, so let us - for the course of this
post - put our [EFK][] stack along with [jaeger] away and get started with something shiny new.

== What is SigNoz?

If you are like me and you haven't heard the name [SigNoz][] before the first and foremost questions are probably
what is SigNoz and why not one of these solutions `insert random product here`.

From a marketing perspective the key selling point for me probably and honestly was the headline on the
frontpage:

[quote,https://signoz.io]
OpenTelemetry-Native Logs, Metrics and Traces in a single pane

Without further knowing before, this was exactly what I need:

. [FOSS][]
. Single solution to address the [three pillars][]
. Nice and complete package

That sounds rather good, but time to put my technical hat and to check the brief.
Thankfully they provide an architecture overview as well and this quickly caught my eye:

++++
{% plantuml %}
!theme unexist from {{ site.asciidoctor_attributes.plantumldir }}

skinparam linetype ortho
skinparam nodesep 20
skinparam ranksep 20

rectangle "App (1))" as app
rectangle "Otel Collector (2)" as otel

card "SigNoz" as signoz {
    rectangle "SigNoz Otel Collector (3)" as sigotel
    database "Clickhouse (4)" as clickhouse
    rectangle "Query Service (5)" as query
    rectangle "Alert Manager (6)" as alert
    rectangle "Frontend (7)" as fe
}

app -[hidden]d-> otel

app -r-> sigotel
otel -l-> sigotel

sigotel --> clickhouse
clickhouse --> query
query <--> alert
query <-> fe
{% endplantuml %}
++++
<1> Apps directly send data to SigNoz
<2> [Otel collectors][] can transmit data as well
<3> Internally sits another collector to provide the endpoints to receive data
<4> Columnar storage? Though I haven't heared of [Clickhouse][] either before
<5> Some abstraction to query the actual data
<6> [Alert Manager][] keeps tracks and handles all the various alerts - glad they haven't reinvented the wheel
<7> And the shiny bit we've spoken of before
