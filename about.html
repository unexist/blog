            My Name is <span class="bold">Christoph Kappel</span> and I am team manager
            of the Software Engineering team at <a href="https://ces.eu">CES</a>.

            In my role I try to reduce accumulated tech debts, minimize tech stacks and bring
            our products technical and architectural forwards.

            Apart from my day job I am an experienced developer and architect with more than
            25 years in tech; both in open-source (FOSS) and in various business fields.

            I am broadly interested in many topics around the technic bubble.
            This ranges from embedded development, over infrastructural topics, up to data analytics
            and obviously people.

            My current go-to language is mainly <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, but
            rather have a look at my <a href="https://hg.unexist.dev">repositories</a> or my
            <a href="https://github.com/unexist">Github</a> profile before I completely drift off.
