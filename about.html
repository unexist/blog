            My name is <span class="bold">Christoph Kappel</span> and I am team manager
            of the Software Engineering team at <a href="https://ces.eu">CES</a>.

            In my role I try to reduce accumulated tech debts, minimize tech stacks and bring
            our products technical and architectural-wise forwards.

            Apart from my day job I am an experienced developer and software architect
            with more than 25 years in tech; both in open-source (FOSS) and in various lines
            of business.

            I am broadly interested in many topics across the sociotech bubble.
            This ranges from embedded development, over infrastructural topics, up to data analytics,
            big data and sometimes people.
