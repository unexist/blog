It has been roughly two years since my last post regarding my experience with the state of AI
({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2023-04-28-coding-with-ai %}[Coding with AI]) and I think it is about
time to talk about this again.

In contract to my previous post, I don't want to dwell on specific products and tools, but
talk about some points about that I think we should pay close attention to and why this topic
is a generally such a mixed bag to me.

Enough chit-chat, let us begin.

== The journey so far

When I look back at the last two years I can probably safely say the whole thing got even more
traction, as we've left the early adopting phase and AI got a lot of traction.

- AI has entered the mainstream and almost everything gets AI support.
- Content is specially {MCP}[prepared for AI systems] apparently without following {mcprcp}[best practices].
- There is an {dailyai}[abundance of new tools] and new companies sprout like {popup}[pop-up stores].
- There are experiments to replace {laborai}[general human labor] and also specific ones like
{nurseai}[nurses in healthcare].
- There are promises {billgatespromised}[AI reduces our daily working time].

So in hindsight everything went according to plan from 2023:

== Asking the right questions

I've spent a lot of time reading about the general progression of AI and besides dozen of blog posts
and other articles for and against AI, also some books to get a broader perspective.

Among these books are following:

- {tamingsiliconvalleybook}[Taming Silicon Valley: How We Can Ensure That AI Works for Us] <<tamingsiliconvalleybook>>
- {theaiconbook}[The AI Con: How to Fight Big Tech's Hype and Create the Future We Want] <<theaiconbook>>
- {searchesbook}[Searches: Selfood in the Digital Age] <<searchesbook>>

I somehow begin to wonder what kind of problems are we trying to address really with AI?

When I I look at the business side I'd say the overall themes are *increase of
productivityfootnote:[Read: getting faster]* like reducing tiresome and/or manual labor and
probably *fear of missing out* competitive advantage.
And on the personal side I mostly see quality-of-life improvements like easy *access to information*
with the help of the natural interfaces like
{chatgpt}[ChatGPT]footnote:[Or just "Chatty" as I've learned recently]
and generational parts to create memes and reels more easily.

This short list is non-exhaustive mind you, but is sufficient for the points I'd like to make next.

=== Increase of productivity

Increasing productivity and reducing work time with technology isn't strictly speaking a new idea,
[line-through]#blue collar# industrial workers faced this already during the mid-19th century
during the {industrialage}[industrial age], but for the first time
[line-through]#white collar# knowledge workers are impacted, and they are probably not backed by
any {labourmovement}[labour union].

There have been lots of riots and protests according to Wikipedia, so apparently the workforce
wasn't all happy with the outcome, but we aren't there *yet*, so let us focus on the promise of
improved work-life-balance.

Interestingly during that time a strange phenomenon could be observed:

[quote,David Graeber,https://davidgraeber.org/articles/on-the-phenomenon-of-bullshit-jobs-a-work-rant]
But rather than allowing a massive reduction of working hours to free the world’s population to
pursue their own projects, pleasures, visions, and ideas, we have seen the ballooning of not even
so much of the ‘service’ sector as of the administrative sector, up to and including the creation
of whole new industries like financial services or telemarketing, or the unprecedented expansion of
sectors like corporate law, academic and health administration, human resources, and public
relations. And these numbers do not even reflect on all those people whose job is to provide
administrative, technical, or security support for these industries, or for that matter the whole
host of ancillary industries (dog-washers, all-night pizza delivery) that only exist because
everyone else is spending so much of their time working in all the other ones.
These are what I propose to call ‘*bullshit jobsfootnote:[Emphasis is mine]*’.

This is just an excerpt of an article written for a magazine under the umbrella of things nobody
would print, as the author points out in his book
{bullshitjobsbook}[Bullshit Jobs] <<bullshitjobsbook>>,
but still the term hits a mark.
There are a lot more examples and explanations in the book or supposedly bullshit jobs and also
jobs that just feel like one, but my key takeaway is the implied question what can our highly
skilled workforce do for a living, when their field of expertise has been replaced with automatons
and we haven't reached a {trektonomic}[moneyless utopia] yet?

[quote,David Graeber,https://davidgraeber.org/articles/on-the-phenomenon-of-bullshit-jobs-a-work-rant]
Hell is a collection of individuals who are spending the bulk of their time working on a task they
don't like and are not especially good at. Say they were hired because they were excellent
cabinet-makers, and then discover they are expected to spend a great deal of their time frying fish.

Another issue I see with increasing productivity is the orientation towards throughput or rather
output in general in information related topics.
Viewed from the business side increasing quantity makes sense to me, this is what the business has
been created for in the first place, but is output the only and ulterior goal and the learning how
to reach and achieve something can be totally neglected?

=== Fear of missing out

If your media feeds are like mine, there is probably something about AI every two or three posts
and depending on the type of media, like e.g. {linkedin}[LinkedIn], the posts are full
of promises and how the full potential of AI can be unlocked to utilize it for your business.

Oftentimes these posts appear to be written with the help of AI and especially
{spotai}}[em-dashes] enjoy increasing popularity.
I think {dogfood}[eating your own dog food] is always advisable, so I see no fault there.
On the other hand, I can rarely find some kind of empirical evidence or any other kind of proof
for these theses and here I consider this usually as a red flag - skepticism can help.

The current hype and pressure increases and academia has also started looking into the phenomenon of
{aifomo}[development of fear of missing out on AI].
And there is an increasingly number of posts and voices besides the ones from common
{aibro][AI Bros] who foretell if you don't start to use AI today you are going to lose your edge.

NOTE: I won't cite any of these posts, but if you are curious here is a starter: <{useaiorlose}>

=== Access to information

Let us start with something positive:
AI does a splendid job of lowering the bar to access information!
Hallucinations vary between dangerous and hilarious and some people are bold enough to state this
is an original {hallucinationasfeat}[feature of LLM design], but with our previous established
skepticism regarding media consumption this *should* be fine.

Delivering probability-based answers to question is only part of the deal, another great application
of these models if for content generation and both goes perfectly hand in hand:

image::ai-first.png[]

I personally think we should just stick to the bullet point list instead of applying a
"prosa-2-text" conversion twice, but still I wonder what happens to the quality of the information
underneath.
Writing this blog post or generally writing is a really time-consuming task.
Drafting a new post and trying to fill the intended outline with content is a tasks which helps me
personally to pinpoint what I really want to sayfootnote:[Or rather I am hoping] and I wouldn't
want to miss this journey.

I am a bit afraid the following is more than true:

[quote,Ben Morris,https://www.ben-morris.com/ai-and-the-creeping-enshittification-of-work]
After all, who are you writing for? Do you care if anybody reads it and how they respond to it?
How can you expect anybody to relate to a piece of writing if it was generated by an AI model?
If you can’t be bothered to write the entire article, you can’t really expect anybody else to be
bothered to read it.

== Impact on society

This is probably the most interesting point and I think it is really difficult to imagine the
world to come and visionaries like {samaltman}[Sam Altman] play a big role in it.
Still, when money gets involved things are sometimes getting sour and I think one of more recent
posts from Altman really condenses the problem down well:

The implied comparison of mass-produced {fastfashion}[fast fashion] with the overgeneralized idea
of {saas}[Software-as-a-Service] is interesting by itself, although I think it is not a good one
to promote your AI services.
For me two of the pain points of fast fashion are the {fastfashionenvironment}[environmental footprint]
and the {fastfashionworker}[exploitation of people] in fabric factories and according
to media the same is true for {aiworker}[the AI industry].
There are many reports of the {aienvironment}[energy requirements of AI] and the references
to the {mechturk}[Mechanical Turk] are also increasing:

[quote,https://restofworld.org/2025/the-ai-con-book-invisible-labor/]
Amazon using this name [Amazon Mechanical Turk] or their product is surprisingly on the nose:
their system also plays the function of hiding the massive amount of labor needed to make any
modern AI infrastructure work.
{imagenet}[ImageNet], during its development in the late 2000s, was the largest
single project hosted on the MTurk platform, according to Li.
It took two and a half years and nearly 50,000 workers across 167 countries to create the dataset.
In the end, the data contained over 14 million images, labeled across 22,000 categories.

I think the real point he wanted to make is with the help of AI can cheap software be mass-produced
instead of paying monthly fees to service providers or individual solutions to problems.
And this works actually well with software, since there is a negligible impact on the environment
in contrast to physical products.

== Conclusion

Currently I am not exactly sure where we are on the hype cycle from the beginning of this post and I
hope the next few months and years will surely show a direction there.
We are going to see if history repeats itself in the protests of workers and if the dystopian
outlooks of the movie {idiocracy}[Idiocracy] stay a work of fiction.

I think my personal usage of AI won't sky rocket any time soon, since I am most of the time
interested in discovering how and why something can be done and rarely just in a fast solution.
Given the situation that I am interested in exactly that and I don't plan on using it beyond this
narrow scope I [line-through]#might ask AI# would still write it myself.

For any other stuff that can readily be automated I totally agree to this:
