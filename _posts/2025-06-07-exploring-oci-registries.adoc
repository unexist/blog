Handling containers is probably something a modern developer can't and probably *should* not live
without anymore.
They provide flexibility, allow easy packaging and also sandboxing of stuff you might not want
to have installed on your machine.

Like so often in tech, using something successfully doesn't imply real understanding how it
works under the hood, but I lived quite happily with this black box and all greasy details
shrouded in mysteries hidden behind tooling like {podman}[Podman].
This changed, when I started looking for an artifact store for our firmware binary artifacts.
I quickly discovered there are many container registries available, but just a few stores for
_ordinary_ artifacts without spending large parts of our engineering budget on enterprise
license fees.
Passing this question to my bubble lead to a suggestion of a good friend  to have a look at
{oras}[ORAS], which leverages {oci}[OCI]-compliant registries for exactly what I wanted to
literally archive.
We are already using Harbor][], so moving other artifacts there as well aroused my interest.

So over the course of this article we are going to dive into the container world with a short
primer of the duality of OCI, talk about basic usage and a few advanced points like {sbom}[SBOM]
and signing and conclude with my impression on the technology.

NOTE: This post includes several introductional chapters as a deep dive into a specific topic.
If you are just here for the examples and how to use the tooling quickly jump ahead and wait for us.

== What is OCI?

Turns out the {oci}[Open Container Initiative (OCI)] isn't a single spec by itself, but rather
a governance body around several container formats and runtimes - namely:

- Runtime Specification ({runtimespec}[runtime-spec])
- Image Specification ({imagespec}[image-spec])
- Distribution Specification ({distspec}[distribution-spec])

The links lead to the related {github}[GitHub] projects in case you want to build your own
container engine, but I suggest we focus on *image-spec*, which lays out the structure in all gory
details.

=== Containers inside out

If you've dutifully studied the spec the overall structure of an actual container will probably
not surprise you.
If not believe me, they are less magically than thought, can be fetched with the help of Podman
and easily be dissected on the shell:

Following links in {json}[JSON]-files and memorizing digests is a bit

<1> *Blobs* is the main directory with all adressable filesystem layers and their related metadata
defined in the appropriate JSON files _config_ and _manifest_.
_The name of the layers are actually digests as well, but to make it easier to follow let us keep the
fancy numbers._
<2> *Config* contains entries like meta information about author as well as other runtime
information like environment variables, entrypoints, volume mounts etc. as well as infos about
specific hardware architecture and OS.
<3> *rootfs* contains an ordered list of the digests that compose the actual image.
<4> The *manifest* just links to the actual configugration by digest and to the layers.
<5> And finally the *index* includes all available manifests and also image annotations.

Mysteries solved, but there is still one essential piece missing - namely media types.

=== What are media types?

This surprises probably no one, but media types are also covered by a spec
footnote:[Really the last one for the course of this post..] - the {mediaspec}[media-spec]

There you can see the exhaustive list of the known types and an implementor's todo list for
compliance to the specs.
Conversely, this also means as long as we pick something different we are free to fill layers with
anything to our liking without triggering a certain behaviour accidentally.

== Use-Cases

The next few examples require an OCI-compatible registry and also access to the binaries of
*oras* and *cosign* and some more.
Since installation is usually a hassle, all examples rely on Podman and the well-supported
{zotreg}[Zot Registry].

=== Firing up Zot

Setting up our registry is just a piece of cake and shouldn't raise any eyebrows yet.
We pretty much set just the bare essentials - *deliberately* without any hardening for actual
logins.

[source,shell]
----
$ podman run --rm -it --name zot-registry -p 5000:5000 --network=host \
  -v ./infrastructure/zot-registry/config.json:/etc/zot/config.json \ # <.>
  ghcr.io/project-zot/zot-linux-amd64:v2.1.2
----
<1> Apart from host stuff we also want to enable the fancy {zotregweb}[web UI] and the {cve}[CVE]
scanner - have a glimpse how this can be done on GitHub: +
<https://github.com/unexist/showcase-oci-registries/blob/master/infrastructure/zot-registry/config.json>

Once started and after {trivy}[Trivy]'s update of the vulnerabilities is done we are dutifully
greeted with an empty list:

.Zot Registry on <http://localhost:5000>
image::zot-empty.png[]

Time to push our first artifact!

=== Pushing a binary artifact

Ultimately I want to push embedded software artifacts to the registry, but since this is public
and my own project {heosdial}[heos-dial] isn't ready yet we are pushing a binary of the
{golang}[Golang] version of my faithful {redoc}[todo service]:

<.> Here we set our custom artifact type, to be able to distinguish it.
<.> No need to make our live miserable with SSL/TLS!
<.> This isn't a _real_ container, so we must provide a {dummyconfig}[dummy config}.

=== Pull it back

One-way-success, time to get it back:

==== Naively with Podman

Pulling images from container registries is one of the core tasks of Podman:

[source,shell]
----
$ podman pull localhost:5000/todo-service:latest
Trying to pull localhost:5000/todo-service:latest...
Error: parsing image configuration: unsupported image-specific operation on artifact with type "showcase/todo-service" # <.>
----
<.> Unsurprisingly Podman doesn't understand our custom artifact type and hence refuses to do our
bidding.

[NOTE]
====
If Podman cannot connect to your local registry and bails out with
`http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client` please make sure to add your *insecure* registry
to your _/etc/containers/registries.conf_ file:

[source,shell]
----
$ tail -n2 /etc/containers/registries.conf
[registries.insecure]
registries = ['localhost:5000']
----

==== Confidently with ORAS

Let us try again - this time with ORAS.

[source,shell]

There are many more helpful {orascmds}[commands] that can be used to interact with stored images,
other types of {blobs}[blobs] and also with supporting files.
Typically among these supporting are museum-less {helm}[Helm]-charts and also {sbom}[SBOM].

== What is an SBOM?

A *software bill of materials* or SBOM is a kind of inventory list of an artifact, which details
included software components and assists in securing the software supply chain.
This gets more and more attention as it should especially since the
{log4j}[log4j vulnerability] back then in 2020 and 2021.

There are different formats for SBOM files like {spdx}[SPDX] or {cyclondedx}[CycloneDX] and also
a broad range of tools that support one or more of them as input and output is available.

I am kind of fondfootnote:[Maybe I just like their mascots?] of Anchore with their tools
{syft}[syft] and {grype}[grype] and therefore the next examples are going to make use of both of
them.

=== Syfting through

Since my todo service is based on Golang syft can easily scan the source code and assemble our
SBOM

[source,shell]
----

=== Scanning for vulnerabilities

Like Trivy, grype can easily scan from inside a container and provide machine-readable statistics
by default:

<.> This gave me a bit of a headache, because Zot supports SBOM scanning and also propagates the results
on the web UI - see the sidepanel for more information.

.SBOM handling in Zot
****
Unfortunately Zot or rather its internal handling of Trivy just allows scans of known media types
and doesn't rely on any specific media type to identify passed SBOM files:

[source,golang,highlight=5]
----
// https://github.com/project-zot/zot/blob/main/pkg/extensions/search/cve/trivy/scanner.go#L278
func (scanner Scanner) isManifestScanable(digestStr string) (bool, error) {
...
    switch imageLayer.MediaType {
    case ispec.MediaTypeImageLayerGzip, ispec.MediaTypeImageLayer, string(regTypes.DockerLayer): # <.>
        continue
    default:
    return false, zerr.ErrScanNotSupported
...
}
----
<.> This relies on borrowed definitions from our known {imagespectypes}[image-spec] as well as
{gocontainerregtypes}[go-containerregistry].

I thought I just got the type wrong, since many pages I've read were a bit vague if it is
`example/sbom` or `sbom/example`.
After several hours I found a pending issue which is kind of related to my problem, but the
timestamp of the issue doesn't look promising though.
I'll put patch-work on my todo listfootnote:[I've got plenty of apps for that..] so I might bring
this forward.

----

Speaking about security:
Just adding images without means of verification if this is the real deal apart from the checksum
doesn't make too much sense too me.

I think the why should be clear, let us talk about how.

== Image signing

Needless to say topics like encryption, signatures etc. are usually pretty complicated, so I
can gladly there exists lots of tooling to ease this for us dramatically.
I did the homework for us  in preparation for this post and checked our options.
While doing that I found lots of references to {notary}[notary] and {skopeo[skopeo], but the full
package and overall documentation of {cosign}[cosign] just convinced me and it can basically sign
anything in a registry.

In this last chapter we are going to sign our image and specific layers via
{intoto}[in-toto attestations] with the help of cosign.

=== Signing the image

Cosign comes with lots of useful commands to create and manage identities, signatures and whatnot,
but in the most convenient way it just allows us to select from a list of supported
{idp}[identity provider] in our browser per runtime:

[source,shell]
----
$ podman run --rm -v .:/workspace --network=host \
    ghcr.io/sigstore/cosign/cosign:v2.4.1 \
    sign --yes \
        localhost:5000/todo-service:latest
Generating ephemeral keys...
Retrieving signed certificate...
Non-interactive mode detected, using device flow.
Enter the verification code xxxx in your browser at: https://oauth2.sigstore.dev/auth/device?user_code=xxxx # <.>
Code will be valid for 300 seconds
Token received!
Successfully verified SCT...
...
By typing 'y', you attest that (1) you are not submitting the personal data of any other person; and (2) you understand and agree to the statement and the Agreement terms at the URLs listed above. # <.>
tlog entry created with index: 230160511
Pushing signature to: localhost:5000/todo-service
----
<.> Quickly follow the link and pick one of your liking - we continue with Github here.
<.> Glad we added `--yes` - interactivity in container is usually a pain.

And when we check the web UI we can see there is a bit of progress:

.Zot Registry on <http://localhost:5000>
image::zot-signed.png[]

Relying on Zot is nice and good, but there are other ways to do that.

=== Verification of the image

It all boils down to another simple call of cosign:

[source,shell]
----
$ podman run --rm -v .:/workspace --network=host \
    ghcr.io/sigstore/cosign/cosign:v2.4.1 \
    verify  \
        --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://github.com/login/oauth \ # <.>
        --certificate-identity=christoph@unexist.dev \
        localhost:5000/todo-service:latest | jq ".[] | .critical" # <.>
Verification for localhost:5000/todo-service:latest --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures: # <.>
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates
{
  "identity": {
    "docker-reference": "localhost:5000/todo-service"
  },
  "image": {
    "docker-manifest-digest": "sha256:fb1f02fff7f1406ae3aa2d9ebf3f931910b69e99c95e78e211037f11ec8f1eb6"
  },
  "type": "cosign container image signature"
}
----
<.> There are several options for verification available - we just rely on issuer and mail.
<.> Apparently this _critical_ is nothing of concern and a
{redhatsigning}[format specificed by RedHat].
<.> This is a short summary of the checks that have been performed during the verification.

Just as a negative test this is how it looks like when the verification actually fails:

[source,shell]
----
$ podman run --rm -v .:/workspace --network=host \
    ghcr.io/sigstore/cosign/cosign:v2.4.1 \
    verify  \
        --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://github.com/login/oauth \
        --certificate-identity=anon@anon.rs \
        localhost:5000/todo-service:latest
Error: no matching signatures: none of the expected identities matched what was in the certificate, got subjects [christoph@unexist.dev] with issuer https://github.com/login/oauth
main.go:69: error during command execution: no matching signatures: none of the expected identities matched what was in the certificate, got subjects [christoph@unexist.dev] with issuer https://github.com/login/oauth
----

First step done - step two is to sign our SBOM as well.

=== Create an in-toto attestation

If you have made it this far in this post I probably shouldn't bore you with another
{intotospec}[spec] about in-toto or the framework around it and just provide the
examples:

[source,shell]
----
$ DIGEST=`podman run --rm -v .:/workspace -it --network=host \
    ghcr.io/oras-project/oras:main \
    discover --format json --plain-http \
        localhost:5000/todo-service:latest | jq -r ".referrers[].reference"` # <.>
$ podman run --rm -v .:/workspace --network=host \
    ghcr.io/sigstore/cosign/cosign:v2.4.1 \
    attest --yes \ # <.>
        --type cyclonedx \ # <.>
        --predicate /workspace/sbom.json \
        $DIGEST
Generating ephemeral keys...
Retrieving signed certificate...
Non-interactive mode detected, using device flow.
Enter the verification code xxxx in your browser at: https://oauth2.sigstore.dev/auth/device?user_code=xxxx
Code will be valid for 300 seconds
Token received!

Using payload from: /workspace/sbom.json
...
By typing 'y', you attest that (1) you are not submitting the personal data of any other person; and (2) you understand and agree to the statement and the Agreement terms at the URLs listed above.
using ephemeral certificate:
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
LOREMIPSUMDOLORSITAMETCONSECTETURADIPISCINGELIT
MORBIIDSODALESESTVIVAMUSVOLUTPATSODALESTINCIDUNT
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

tlog entry created with index: 232176597
----
<.> We need the digest to identify our artifact for the next steps - so please keep it at hand.
<.> Don't forget to deal with the interactive prompt here.
<.> Some information about type and name of what cosign is supposed to attest.

NOTE: cosign still supports the older command {cosignattachsbom}[attach sbom] to attach artifacts,
but the it is deprecated and it is generally advised to use proper attestations.
There is a heaty debate about its status and maturity though.

=== Download attestation

As mentiond before this is complex, so let us have a closer look at what we can actually get back.

[source,shell]
----
$ podman run --rm -v .:/workspace --network=host \
    ghcr.io/sigstore/cosign/cosign:v2.4.1 \
    download attestation \
        $DIGEST | jq "del(.payload)" # <.>
{
  "payloadType": "application/vnd.in-toto+json", # <.>
  "signatures": [
    {
      "keyid": "",
      "sig": "MEYCIQDE4/CeQstLjHLE+ZQ+BCH+aaw2wSWSr9i26d7iuazXrwIhAPtly5XBD6C14s/78vTjuHdLOjj2a9TeSgs0yD6YRrZd"
    }
  ]
}
----
<.> We omit the payload data here - feel free to dump your own base64 blob
<.> This is the actual type of the payload that has been transmitted.

If you want to see the actual content of the payload here is a small exercise for you:

[source,shell]
----
$ podman run --rm -v .:/workspace --network=host \
    ghcr.io/sigstore/cosign/cosign:v2.4.1 \
    download attestation \
        $DIGEST | jq -r .payload | base64 -d | jq .predicate
----

=== Verification of the attestation

And lastly in the same manner as before the attestation can also be verified by the means of
cosign:

[source,shell]
----
$ podman run --rm -v .:/workspace --network=host \
    ghcr.io/sigstore/cosign/cosign:v2.4.1 \
    verify-attestation  \
        --type cyclonedx \
        --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://github.com/login/oauth \
        --certificate-identity=christoph@unexist.dev \
        $DIGEST | jq ".[] | .critical"
podman run --rm -v .:/workspace --network=host \
    ghcr.io/sigstore/cosign/cosign:v2.4.1 \
    verify-attestation  \
        --type cyclonedx \ # <.>
        --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://github.com/login/oauth \
        --certificate-identity=christoph@unexist.dev \
        $DIGEST > /dev/null # <.>

Verification for localhost:5000/todo-service@sha256:5c6bb144aaed7d3e4eb58ac6bcdbf2a68d0409d5328f81c9d413e9301e2517a9 --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates
Certificate subject: christoph@unexist.dev
Certificate issuer URL: https://github.com/login/oauth
----
<.> Here we pass some expectations to the checks.
<.> We don't want to see the exact same content from the previous step again.

Passing bogus information or trying to verify the wrong digest leads to an error:

[source,shell]
----
podman run --rm -v .:/workspace --network=host \
    ghcr.io/sigstore/cosign/cosign:v2.4.1 \
    verify-attestation  \
        --type cyclonedx \
        --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://github.com/login/oauth \
        --certificate-identity=anon@anon.rs \
        $DIGEST > /dev/null
Error: no matching attestations: none of the expected identities matched what was in the certificate, got subjects [christoph@unexist.dev] with issuer https://github.com/login/oauth
main.go:74: error during command execution: no matching attestations: none of the expected identities matched what was in the certificate, got subjects [christoph@unexist.dev] with issuer https://github.com/login/oauth
----

Phew that was quite lengthy to reach this point, time for a small recap.

== Conclusion

During the course of this post we have seen how OCI-registries can be leveraged to store almost
any kind of artifact.
The layered structure and format allows to add additional metadata and ancillary artifacts like
Helm-charts can be put there to rest as well.

Bill of materials allow quick scan of layers for known vulnerabilities and combined with proper
signing can the security of the supply chain be further strengthened.
Alas this is also no {silverbullet}[silver bullet] and takes lots of work to get it right in
automatic workflows.

I personally think this is a great addition, solves my initial hunt for artifact storage and also
eases the handling of all the dependencies of different kind of artifacts in a more secure way.
Next stop for me is to compile all this into a shiny new
{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2024-10-25-decision-records %}[Architecture Decision Record].
and discuss is with my team.

All examples can be found here hidden in the {taskfile}[taskfiles]:
