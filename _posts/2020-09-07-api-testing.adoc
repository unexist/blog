Testing APIs is getting more and more complex and therefore there's lots of tooling out there to
assist.

One of the better known-tools is {1}[Postman], but I am annoyed of it lately.
The UI is really slow and sometimes it is quite painful to get around with it, especially with the
collections. A plus is the handling of tests.

The more light-weight version {2}[Hoppscotch] (formerly known as *postwoman*) makes the UI a bit
easier to handle, because it is browser-based without the whole electron bloat, but still kind of
weird.

So far I {3}[Testmace] makes a good impression on me, but unfortunately I don't have it on my
testing rig and cannot give it a try for real things.

The same is true for {4}[Insomnia], it looks promising and I really dig the idea of separating the
designing stuff from the base testing tool.

One of my latest discoveries is {5}[Portman] and the description sounds promising, although I hadn't
time to give a try yet..

Another new entry to the list is {6}[Bruno], which really feels lightweight and avoids all the
clutter Postman is plagued by.
