For a new gig, we started with a bunch of new people with various sets of
knowledge and skills. Without any way to assess, where our strengths and
weaknesses are, it is kind of difficult to say, if we are covered in the
requires areas.

Someone stumbled upon a promising google sheet, which exactly does what we need:

[Skill Mapping](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/skill-mapping/)

It allows to pick some categories, enter names and basically ask the team to
evaluate their own skill. Basically all you need for number and for graphical
people.

I am really curious, what the result of this is going to be and how the team
reacts to it.

To be continued.
