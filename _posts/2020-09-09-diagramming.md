TL;DR: Never found a good way to automate it; but nice tools.

While checking for ways to automate the creation of sequence diagrams I came across
[sequencediagram.org](https://sequencediagram.org) and really liked the ease of use and syntax.

Although the syntax is quite similar to the one of [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/), I really
appreciate the idea to do just one thing in your browser. No client, no frills.

Another good one is:
[mingrammer/diagrams](https://github.com/mingrammer/diagrams/blob/master/README.md)

I still lack a proper usecase, but the overall idea is nice and it is good to have a tool to chart
 cloud-based interaction.
