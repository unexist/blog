{1}[AsciiDoc] is one of my favorite text processors for anything related to
**Documentation-as-Code**.

I use it quite excessively in my current project, for documentation on service level but also for
architecture documentation based on {2}[ARC42].

TIP: If you really want to look into it I suggest to have a look at the documentation
{3}[Asciidoc Writer's Guide].

It is as convenient as {4}[Markdown] and has a few other tricks up its sleeve like support for
images and a proper way to use a hierarchy of documents.
The only thing that kind of annoys me is the import idiocy - a few of you probably know from
{5}[PHP]:

If you include something from a subdirectory, all other other includes are relative
to this new root now.
This leads to interesting issues, especially if you want to deal with images.

== Images

One of the few things that you commonly see is basically to prefix every image include with the
**:imagedir:** attribute:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:imagedir: ./images
image::foobar.png[caption=Test]
----

This leads to lots of redundancy and makes a change of this quite nasty, once you are dealing
with a large document.

== Maven

When you are using {6}[maven], there is another way just to set the
**imagedir** attribute inside of your {7}[pom]:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.asciidoctor</groupId>
    <artifactId>asciidoctor-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${asciidoctor.maven.plugin.version}</version>

    <configuration>
        <attributes>
            <imagesdir>./images</imagesdir>
        </attributes>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

== IntelliJ

There seems to be some kind of unwritten rule, that {8}[IntelliJ] **always** has to fail for
something that works quite nicely with {6}[maven] even when you install the {9}[asciidoc plugin] -
so no surprises here.

After some digging around, I discovered {10}[this config file]:

The plugin supports the usage of a config file, that can be placed in the root level of your
document and gets prefixed automatically to every {1}[AsciiDoc] file that
is below this paths:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:icons: font
:imagesdir: {asciidoctorconfigdir}/images
