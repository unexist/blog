I've been using {1}[Citrix] and a Windows VM for quite a while, almost two years and never got used
to the changes of the shortcuts.

And with macOS as host and windows in a VM it becomes quite nasty.

So I spend some hours to figure out how to bind the proper commands to get a faster workflow and I
can already say it always pays to do exactly that.

I normally just learn new commands and shortcuts, whenever I do pair/mob, but while reading through
the possible commands I found some helpful things.

Like popup menus for run configs and open file buffers..
