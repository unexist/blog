Writing tests is hard, writing acceptances tests for non-coders is especially another ring of hell.
There are various frameworks around, like [Cucumber][1] and all the other BDD approaches.

I never dived into it, but looks like I know have some time in a project to give it a try.

Just a few days before, some colleague ranted about [Gradle][5], [Groovy][3] and something new to
me, the [Spock framework][4].

I can't be helped, but I kind of like it and the resulting tests. They look quite readable for me
and should also be understandable for non-techs.

So thanks, another thing I have to dig into.

To be continued.
