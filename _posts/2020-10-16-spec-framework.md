Writing tests is hard, writing acceptances tests for non-coders is especially
another ring of hell. There are various frameworks around, like [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io) 
and all the other BDD aproaches.

I never dived into it, but looks like I know have some time in a project to
give it a try.

Just a few days before, some colleague ranted about [Gradle](https://gradle.org),
[Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org) and something new to me, the [Spock framework](http://spockframework.org/)

I can't be helped, but I kind of like it and the resulting tests. They look quite
readable for me and should also be understandable for non-techs.

So thanks, another thing I have to dig into.

To be continued.
