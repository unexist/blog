Yesterday we had another discussion about architecture documentation and especially about decisions
made about it.
We came to a quick agreement, that the form makes no difference, but that there **is** a dire need
for a way to see, **why** something is like it is.

One of the tooling suggestions here is {1}[ADR] along with the {2}[adr-tools]), which basically is
just a helper for easy to handle markdown files, which can either be placed next to the code (for
microservices) or into a dedicated repository. (for macro-architecture)

I am always in favor to have docs next to code, so the chance that:

. Someone really reads it and more importantly
. Keeps it up to date is better.

From my experience a wiki is just a collection of outdated files: *Barely read; never updated*.

Now that we have nice tools for our handiwork, we have to think about **who** writes docs and first
and foremost **when**?

The latter is really easy, whenever a decision is made like which technology stack, which testing
framework and so on, just write an entry.

And the answer to the first question? **Probably you!**
