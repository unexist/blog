Oh well - process management under windows is a kind of pain.
I especially had to deal with my {1}[maven]/{2}[Quarkus]/{3}[IntelliJ] combination:

I can easily start {2}[Quarkus] and attach a debugger, but {3}[Intellij] always fails to stop the
related processes and ends up stuck.
For a while, I used the task manager to manually kill the processes.

Sometimes I didn't kill all properly and the port was blocked etc, you probably know the drill.

{4}[wmic] to the rescue!
With it, you can basically use SQL-ish syntax to do funny things like killing
 processes:

[source,shell]
----
$ wmic process where "commandline like '%%projectname%%jar%%'" delete
----

Just put this inside of a batch file and tell intellij to call it.
Et voila!
