I've been in a meetup recently and it was about architecture validation with the help of
our good friend {1}[jqAssistant].
Although I didn't learn much new in the first part, the second part was highly interesting:

Combine {2}[ADR] with the asciidoc processing of {1}[jqAssistant].
I've never thought about it before, but once the speaker presented this idea I was totally into it.

== ADR tools

For a starter, we need to add {3}[AsciiDoc] support to the ADR tooling,
since they normally are written in markdown.
There is a pending PR that does exactly that:

<https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools/pull/101>

Or if you need a complete set along with other nifty things like indexing a database
(sqlite3) handling and basic atom/rss support, just use my version of it:

<https://github.com/unexist/adr-tools>

Once we've picked our version, we need to set this up accordingly:

[source,shell]
----
$ adr-tools/adr init -t adoc jqassistant/decisions

$ adr-tools/adr new "Assertion Library"
----

== First steps with jqAssistant

Messing with {1}[jqAssistant] is always funny, when you manage to make your mind about {4}[cypher],
you are busy with lots of flaky tests and varying output errors, but we'll come to that later I
guess.

I also will not go into detail how to set up jgAssistant or how to create a bootstrap project and
focus on the funny parts. If you want to dive head first just checkout my demo project:

Back to our new ADR, let us just fill in a bit of magic:

== Revisit our ADR

[source,asciidoc]
-----
= 1. Assertion library

| Proposed Date: | 2021-03-15
| Decision Date: | ?
| Proposer:      | Christoph Kappel
| Deciders:      | ?
| Status:        | drafted
| Issues:        | ?

| Priority:      | high
|===

NOTE: *Status types:* drafted | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded +
      *Priority:* low | medium | high

== Context

There are dozen of assertion library available, we want to settle one for
our purpose and rely just on this one.

== Decision

After some consideration we agreed on using https://assertj.github.io/doc/[AssertJ].

== Consequences

[[adr:AssertionLibrary]]
[source,cypher,role=constraint,severity=minor]
.All calls to `assertThat` must be from `AssertJ`!
----
MATCH
      (assertType:Type)-[:DECLARES]->(assertMethod) // <1>
WHERE
      NOT assertType.fqn =~ "org.assertj.core.api.*" // <2>
            AND assertMethod.signature =~ ".*assertThat.*"
WITH
      assertMethod
MATCH
      (testType:Type)-[:DECLARES]->(testMethod:Method),
      (testMethod)-[invocation:INVOKES]->(assertMethod)
RETURN
      testType.fqn + "#" + testMethod.name as TestMethod, // <3>
      invocation.lineNumber as LineNumber
ORDER BY
      TestMethod, LineNumber
----

include::jQA:Rules[concepts="adr:AssertionLibrary*", constraints="adr:AssertionLibrary*"] // <4>
-----
<1> Simple query in {4}[cypher] for all methods that have `assertThat' in its method signature.
<2> Check, if if the full-qualified name of the package is NOT `org.assertj.core.api`.
<3> Return the name of the method, along with its line number for every match.
<4> This is required to see the actual results in the rendered document, took me quite a whole to
figure this out.

So this is basically the complete ADR and I assume most of the things beside the weird code block
is pretty self explanatory.
When this list is empty the test passes, if not you'll get a neat nice table below the definition
in the output.

== Put it to the test in jqAssistant

So we have to jump right back to {1}[jqAssistant], since we are done with the ADR.

Next best thing to do is to create an `index.adoc` document for jqAssistant to render:

[source,asciidoc]

[[default]] // <1>
[role=group,includesGroups="adr:default"]
== Architecture decisions, tests and metrics

This document contains example https://jqassistant.org/[jqAssistant] rules
along with simple https://adr.github.io/[Architecture Decision Records].

[[adr:default]]
[role=group,includesConcepts="adr:*",includesConstraints="adr:*"] // <2>
== List of Architecture Decision Records

\include::decisions/0001-assertion-library.adoc[leveloffset=2]
----
<1> The default group is **required**, otherwise {1}[jqAssistant] will not pick up this document
and render nothing at all.
<2> Include the ADR into our main document.

== Conclusion

Both tools can be used to write tests for architecture.
The addition of a graph database in {1}[jqAssistant] along with the query language {4}[Cypher] and
the different input plugins allow more flexibility, but also set a steep learning curve.
