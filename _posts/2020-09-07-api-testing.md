Testing APIs is getting more and more complex and therefore there's lots of tooling out there to
assist.

One of the better known-tools is [Postman][1], but I am annoyed of it lately.
The UI is really slow and sometimes it is quite painful to get around with it, especially with the
collections. A plus is the handling of tests.

The more light-weight version [Hoppscotch][2] (formerly known as *postwoman*) makes the UI a bit
easier to handle, because it is browser-based without the whole electron bloat, but still kind of
weird.

So far I [Testmace][3] makes a good impression on me, but unfortunately I don't have it on my
testing rig and cannot give it a try for real things.

The same is true for [Insomnia][4], it looks promising and I really dig the idea of separating the
designing stuff from the base testing tool.
