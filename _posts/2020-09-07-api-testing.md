Testing APIs is getting more and more complex and therefore there's lots of
tooling out there to assist.

One of the better known-tools is [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), but
I am annoyed of it lately. The UI is really slow and sometimes it is quite
painful to get around with it, especially with the collections. A plus is
the handling of tests.

The more light-weight version [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/) (formerly
known as *postwoman*) makes the UI a bit easier to handle, because it is
browser-based without the whole electron bloat, but still kind of weird.

So far I [Testmace](https://testmace.com/) makes a good impression on me,
but unfortunately I don't have it on my testing rig and cannot give it a
try for real things.

The same is true for [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), it looks promising and
I really dig the idea of separating the designing stuff from the base testing
tool.
