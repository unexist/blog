Starters like the one in the linked article always hook me, I probably don't have to actually
suggest to read this series and pray for any successor in our lifetime.

Still, naming things is difficult, especially in a changing world like ours. When you settle for a
name, you sometimes end adding stuff to justify the given name.

Ever built a manager, that wasn't actually managing anything?

One suggestion here is to use a fixed scheme like colors and give the resulting thing a meaning
name, once you are happy with the result.
