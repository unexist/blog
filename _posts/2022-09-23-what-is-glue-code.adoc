I am more and more interested in {1}[acceptance testing] lately and if you browse through the
posts of this blog you are going to find one or another post about the whole idea along with some
noteworthy tooling.

One aspect I haven't touched so far far is how do we bring the actual tests *and* the
{26}[system under test] (SUT) together and if we use code, where should it reside?

Let us start with a small recap, so we all are on the same page and than move on to the sparking
bits after that.

== A small recap

The general idea of {2}[behavior-driven development] is to consider a software component as a
**blackbox** and describe (and later verify) the observable behavior without any knowledge of
its internal workings or the chosen technology - this is in contrast to other tests, which follow
a **whitebox** approach.

Naturally, a {27}[test-driven development] approach works pretty well here, but there really is no
requirement to this or even to be standing on a green field.

When you are sitting in front of a huge pile of [line-through]#shi# code and are desperately
trying to figure out what it should do exactly, it even morel beneficial to explore the behavior
and document it - supported by actual examples.

NOTE: {24}[Michael C. Feathers] calls these tests {3}[characterization tests] in his book
{32}[Working Effectively with Legacy Code] <<legacycode>>.

So far the theory - example time!

== Use cases

The following use cases are again based on a simple todo application with a {22}[REST] endpoint to
create and manage todo entries - an {19}[OpenAPI] can be found {9}[here].

=== Use case #1: Create a todo with title and description

The creation is pretty straight forward, we just have to pass a `title` and a `description` over
to our endpoint and verify, if we receive the `id` of a newly created entry.

If we rephrase this to the {28}[Three R] format (coined by {4}[Connextra]) used for stories in many
agile teams, we end up with something like this:

----
As a user, I want to create a new todo entry with title and description, so that it is stored
with an unique ID for later retrieval.
----

Equipped with this, let us dive into how this can be done with {5}[Cucumber] and {15}[Karate].

==== Cucumber

A {7}[Gherkin] scenario intentionally resembles the {28}[Three R] and can be easily translated into
_almost_ natural language:

[source,gherkin]
----
Feature: Create a todo

  Scenario Outline: Create a todo with title and description and check the id.
    Given I create a todo # <1>
    When its title is "<title>" # <2>
    And its description is "<description>"
    Then its id should be <id> # <3>

    Examples:
      | title  | description  | id |
      | title1 | description1 | 1  |
      | title2 | description2 | 2  |
----
<1> This describes who wants to do something. (`Role`)
<2> Next up is what is needed. (`Requirements`)
<3> And finally why.. (`Reason`)

Calling {5}[Cucumber] a simple pattern matcher probably doesn't live up to it, but for all practical
matters it is exactly that.
(__Trust me on that - you can replace each of `given/when/then` with a simple `*` and it still
magically works__)

There are many different {17}[language bindings] available, but here we want to focus on the {13}[JVM]
one:

[source,java]
----
public class TodoSteps {
    private final DateTimeFormatter dtf = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd");
    private RequestSpecification requestSpec;
    private TodoBase todoBase;
    private DueDate dueDate;

    @Before
    public void beforeScenario() {
        this.requestSpec = new RequestSpecBuilder()
                .setPort(8081)
                .setContentType(ContentType.JSON)
                .setAccept(ContentType.JSON)
                .build();
    }

    @Given("I create a todo") // <1>
    public void given_create_todo() {
        this.todoBase = new TodoBase();
        this.dueDate = new DueDate();
    }

    @When("its title is {string}") // <2>
    public void when_set_title(String title) {
        this.todoBase.setTitle(title);
    }

    @And("its description is {string}") // <3>
    public void and_set_description(String description) {
        this.todoBase.setDescription(description);
    }

    @Then("its id should be {int}") // <4>
    public void then_get_id(int id) {
        String location = given(this.requestSpec)
            .when()
                .body(this.todoBase)
                .post("/todo")
            .then()
                .statusCode(201)
            .and()
                .extract().header("location");

        assertThat(location.substring(location.lastIndexOf("/") + 1))
                .isEqualTo(Integer.toString(id));
    }
}
----
<1> On a match create a new Todo object.
<2> Set a title to our Todo object.
<3> ..and also set a description.
<4> And finally call the endpoint and assert whatever comes back.

There are no surprises here - so let's see how this can be done in {15}[Karate].

==== Karate

{15}[Karate] also relies on the {7}[Gherkin] language and I am most certain you see similarities
here.
In contrast to the previous example with {5}[Cucumber] we don't have to write any {11}[Java] code
to get this running.
Under the hood, {15}[Karate] uses a full-fledged {10}[html engine] and provides built-ins or rather
special {16}[keywords] for the actual tests:

[source,gherkin]
----
Feature: Create a todo

  Background:
    * url 'http://localhost:8081' # <1>

  Scenario Outline: Create a todo with title and description and check the id.
    Given path 'todo' # <2>
    And request # <3>
    """
    {
      "title": <title>,
      "description": <description>
    }
    """
    When method post # <4>
    Then match header location ==  "#regex .*/todo/<id>" # <5>

    Examples:
      | title    | description    | id |
      | 'title1' | 'description1' | 1  |
      | 'title2' | 'description2' | 2  |
----

<1> Point the internal engine to the given {31}[url].
<2> Update the {20}[path] of the current location.
<3> Define the actual {21}[request] {12}[JSON] body.
<4> Set the HTTP {18}[method] and fire the request.
<5> And again - compare whatever comes back - here the {8}[header].

What about another example, that relies less on materials on board?

=== Use case #2: Create a todo with start and due date

Instead of sending a real request to our backend, we want to verify the internal logic of our
domain object this time.
Aforementioned logic here is, whenever we create a todo with a `due` date after the `start` date,
it should automatically be marked as `done`.
(__Honestly I also think this is a really strange requirement, but sometimes it is like that.__)

To get some practice here, let's convert it to the {28}[Three R] format as well:

----
As a user, I want to create a new todo entry with a start and a due date, so that it is
automatically marked as done, when the due date is after start, to avoid unaccomplishable tasks.
----

==== Cucumber

The actual translation from the {28}[Three R] format to a scenario is quickly done:

[source,gherkin]
----
  Scenario Outline: Create a todo with start and due dates and check the status.
    Given I create a todo
    When it starts on <start>
    And it ends on <due>
    Then it should be marked as <status>

    Examples:
      | start      | due        | status  |
      | 2021-09-10 | 2022-09-10 | undone  |
      | 2021-09-10 | 2021-09-09 | done    |
----

[source,java]
----
public class TodoSteps {
    private final DateTimeFormatter dtf = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd");
    private RequestSpecification requestSpec;
    private TodoBase todoBase;
    private DueDate dueDate;

    @Before
    public void beforeScenario() {
        this.requestSpec = new RequestSpecBuilder()
                .setPort(8081)
                .setContentType(ContentType.JSON)
                .setAccept(ContentType.JSON)
                .build();
    }

    @Given("I create a todo")
    public void given_create_todo() {
        this.todoBase = new TodoBase();
        this.dueDate = new DueDate();
    }

    @When("it starts on {datestr}") // <1>
    public void when_set_start_date(LocalDate startDate) {
        this.dueDate.setStart(startDate);
    }

    @And("it ends on {datestr}")
    public void and_set_due_date(LocalDate dueDate) {
        this.dueDate.setDue(dueDate);
    }

    @Then("it should be marked as {status}") // <2>
    public void then_get_status(boolean status) {
        this.todoBase.setDueDate(this.dueDate);

        assertThat(status).isEqualTo(this.todoBase.getDone());
    }

    @ParameterType("[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}") // <3>
    public LocalDate datestr(String datestr) {
        return LocalDate.parse(datestr, this.dtf);
    }

    @ParameterType("done|undone")
    public boolean status(String status) {
        return "done".equalsIgnoreCase(status);
    }
}
----
<1> Set `start` and `due` date.
<2> And also set the `status` of the entry.
<3> Convert different types.

Parameter types (or {29}[Transformers] in older versions of {5}[Cucumber]) can help to encapsulate and
convey domain concepts like the `status`.
A positive side effect is they also allow to adhere to the {6}[DRY] principle by not repeating
information - here how to convert input to a date.
Apart from that, the second {5}[Cucumber] example is basically the same all over again - this
changes with with the next one.

==== Karate

This example is heavier on the glue code side and since we normally don't use {11}[Java] directly
for {15}[Karate] tests, we have to find a way to call {11}[Java] directly.
Fortunately, {14}[Karate DSL] also provides helper here and we can implement the tests like we did
before:

[source,gherkin]
----
  Scenario Outline: Create a todo with start and due dates and check the status.
    Given def createTodo = # <1>
    """
    function(args) {
      var TodoType = Java.type("dev.unexist.showcase.todo.domain.todo.Todo"); // <2>
      var DueDateType = Java.type("dev.unexist.showcase.todo.domain.todo.DueDate");
      var DateTimeFormatterType = Java.type("java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter");
      var LocalDateType = Java.type("java.time.LocalDate");

      var dtf = DateTimeFormatterType.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd"); // <3>

      var dueDate = new DueDateType();

      dueDate.setStart(LocalDateType.parse(args.startDate, dtf));
      dueDate.setDue(LocalDateType.parse(args.dueDate, dtf));

      var todo = new TodoType();

      todo.setDueDate(dueDate);

      return todo.getDone() ? "done" : "undone";
    }
    """
    When def result = call createTodo { startDate: <start>, dueDate: <due> } // <4>
    Then match result == "<status>" // <5>

    Examples:
      | start      | due        | status |
      | 2021-09-10 | 2022-09-10 | undone |
      | 2021-09-10 | 2021-09-09 | done   |
----
<1> Define a function that executes the test.
<2> Create a wrapper for our required {11}[Java] classes.
<3> Implement the actual test in the next few lines.
<4> Call the previously defined method and pass the values from the table.
<5> ..and verify the {23}[result].

== Conclusion

What can we learn from both examples?

- Glue code is generally all code, that is required to combine the actual test with the
{26}[system under test] and resides somewhere in between.
- {5}[Cucumber] separates the glue code from the actual features, whereas {15}[Karate] includes them in
the feature file.
- {5}[Cucumber] advises to keep technical details out of the features, {15}[Karate] benefits the
combination of both.

I think the real answer is somewhere in the middle - in my opinion separating the technical details
from the actual specification is beneficial, because it becomes robust to changes of the underlying
systems and doesn't have to be touched whenever the implementation changes.

This also depends on the included functions and people:

- When the *business side* defines the specifications and also writes the feature files less technical
is easier to understand and favors focus on the development of a {30}[Ubiquitous Language] for the
business domain.
- On the other hand, when *dev* writes the specifications, keeping both bundled together helps to
avoid any drift between specification and the technical tests.

All examples can be found in my acceptance testing showcase at the usual place:
