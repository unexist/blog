When I think about orchestration, {28}[Kubernetes] is something that easily comes up to my mind.
With its massive ecosystem and all the different companies, that provide even more services, it is
a big solution to [.line-through]#even bigger# *enterprisy* problems.

On multiple occasions, I thought about setting up a small {28}[Kubernetes] cluster on my own, but to
be honest the initial drag to get it running usually beats my original usecase *and* every bit of
motivation.

Isn't there something lightweight?

== What is Nomad?

{30}[Nomad] is a small job scheduler and orchestrator from {15}[HashiCorp] and relies on plugins
to run nearly anything - given that there is a proper task driver.

There is an exhaustive list of provided task drivers like {10}[Docker], {19}[Java] or
{34}[raw/exec] to name a few and some of them are community-driven.
Docs {18}[how to provide new ones] are also available, so expect this list to grow even further.

Before we can start playing with the actual objects, we have to talk about configuration.

== Configuration without YAML

By design, {28}[Kubernetes] follows a {9}[declarative approach] and allows to specify the desired
outcome of your objects in a {43}[YAML] file.
If you want to change something programmatically or even parameterize you can either use the API
directly and patch your objects or rely on tools like {17}[helm] or {29}[kustomize].

{30}[Nomad] follows a similar approach, but utilizes {15}[HashiCorp]'s own configuration language
{16}[HCL], which was initially introduced for {41}[Terraform] to add logic to the mix without the
syntactic weirdness of {25}[jsonnet] or {10}[Docker]'s {7}[CUE].

Here is a quick example, but more about it can be found on the {31}[official page]:

[source,hcl]
----
name = "unexist"
message = "Name: ${name}"
loud_message = upper(message)
colors = [ "red", "blue" ]
options = {
  color: element(colors, 1),
  amount: 100
}

configuration {
  service "greeter" {
    message = loud_message
    options = var.override_options ? var.override_options : var.options
  }
}
----

Keep that in mind, this might be handy later.

== Working with jobs

When you want to run something on {30}[Nomad], you normally start with a {24}[job].
A {24}[job] - or rather a job file - is the primary work horse and describes the tasks you want to
run in a declarative way.

Behind the scene, whenever a {24}[job] is submitted, {30}[Nomad] starts with an {12}[evaluation] to
determine necessary steps for this workload.
Once this is done, {30}[Nomad] maps the {40}[task group] of our {24}[job] to a client node and
schedules it there - this is called an {1}[allocation].

There are many different object types, but it is probably easier just to start with a concrete
example and explain it line by line as we go:

[source,hcl]
----
job "todo" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"] # <1>

  group "web" { # <2>
    count = 1 # <3>

    task "todo" { # <4>
      driver = "java" # <5>

      config { # <6>
        jar_path = "/Users/christoph.kappel/Projects/showcase-nomad-quarkus/target/showcase-nomad-quarkus-0.1-runner.jar"
        jvm_options = ["-Xmx256m", "-Xms256m"]
      }

      resources { # <7>
        memory = 256
      }
    }

    network { # <8>
      port "http" {
        static = 8080
      }
    }
  }
}
----
<1> Sets of multiple client nodes are called a datacenter in {30}[Nomad].
<2> Groups consist of multiple tasks that are run together on the same client node.
<3> Start at most one instance of this group.
<4> This is the actual task definition and the smallest unit inside of {30}[Nomad] - like a {44}[Pod].
<5> The {19}[Java] task driver allows to run a jar inside of a {27}[JVM].
<6> Config options for the chosen task driver.
<7> {35}[Resource limits] can also be set - here we stick with limits for memory.
<8> And additionally network settings for the whole task-group.  (We need the port definition later)

The next steps assume you've successfully set up and started {30}[Nomad], if not please have a look
at the {14}[great resources here].

=== How to start a job

There are multiple ways to interact with {30}[Nomad]:

==== Via browser

There is a small web-interface available right after start: <http://localhost:4646>

image::web.png[]

After pressing the **Run Job** button in the right upper corner, you can paste your {24}[job]
definition either in {16}[HCL] or in {26}[JSON].

The **Plan** button starts a dry-run and {30}[Nomad] prints the result:

image::plan_success.png[]

And a final press on **Run** starts the actual deployment.

image::job_success.png[]

==== Via commandline

For the commandline-savy, there is nice {5}[CLI] shipped within the same package:

[source,shell]
----
$ nomad job plan jobs/todo-java.nomad
+ Job: "todo"
+ Task Group: "web" (1 create)
  + Task: "todo" (forces create)

Scheduler dry-run:
- All tasks successfully allocated.

$ nomad job run jobs/todo-java.nomad
==> 2022-07-18T17:48:36+02:00: Monitoring evaluation "2c21d49b"
    2022-07-18T17:48:36+02:00: Evaluation triggered by job "todo"
==> 2022-07-18T17:48:37+02:00: Monitoring evaluation "2c21d49b"
    2022-07-18T17:48:37+02:00: Evaluation within deployment: "83abca16"
    2022-07-18T17:48:37+02:00: Allocation "d9ec1c42" created: node "d419df0b", group "web"
    2022-07-18T17:48:37+02:00: Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> 2022-07-18T17:48:37+02:00: Evaluation "2c21d49b" finished with status "complete"
==> 2022-07-18T17:48:37+02:00: Monitoring deployment "83abca16"
  âœ“ Deployment "83abca16" successful

    2022-07-18T17:48:47+02:00
    ID          = 83abca16
    Job ID      = todo
    Job Version = 0
    Status      = successful
    Description = Deployment completed successfully

    Deployed
    Task Group  Desired  Placed  Healthy  Unhealthy  Progress Deadline
    web         1        1       1        0          2022-07-18T17:58:46+02:00
----

==== Via API

More hardcore users can also access the {20}[job API] with e.g. {8}[curl] directly:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl --request POST --data @jobs/todo-java.json http://localhost:4646/v1/jobs
{"EvalCreateIndex":228,"EvalID":"bd809b77-e2c6-c336-c5ca-0d1c15ff6cce","Index":228,"JobModifyIndex":228,"KnownLeader":false,"LastContact":0,"NextToken":"","Warnings":""}
----

NOTE: You can find the example in JSON here: <https://github.com/unexist/showcase-nomad-quarkus/blob/master/deployment/jobs/todo-java.json>

All three ways send the {24}[job] to {30}[Nomad] and start a single instance on clients that belong
to the datacenter aptly named `dc1`.

=== Check status of a job

The status of our {24}[job] can be queried in similar fashion:

[source,shell]
----
$ nomad job status
ID    Type     Priority  Status   Submit Date
todo  service  50        running  2022-07-18T17:48:36+02:00
----

Or just use {8}[curl] to access our service directly:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/todo
*   Trying ::1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8080 (#0)
> GET /todo HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
> Accept: application/json
>
< HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
<
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
* Closing connection 0
----

=== Stop jobs again

And without more further ado - {23}[jobs] can be stopped like this:

[source,shell]
----
$ nomad job stop todo
==> 2022-07-18T18:04:55+02:00: Monitoring evaluation "efe42497"
    2022-07-18T18:04:55+02:00: Evaluation triggered by job "todo"
==> 2022-07-18T18:04:56+02:00: Monitoring evaluation "efe42497"
    2022-07-18T18:04:56+02:00: Evaluation within deployment: "577c3e71"
    2022-07-18T18:04:56+02:00: Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> 2022-07-18T18:04:56+02:00: Evaluation "efe42497" finished with status "complete"
==> 2022-07-18T18:04:56+02:00: Monitoring deployment "577c3e71"
  âœ“ Deployment "577c3e71" successful

    2022-07-18T18:04:56+02:00
    ID          = 577c3e71
    Job ID      = todo
    Job Version = 2
    Status      = successful
    Description = Deployment completed successfully

    Deployed
    Task Group  Desired  Placed  Healthy  Unhealthy  Progress Deadline
    web         1        1       1        0          2022-07-18T18:12:24+02:00
----

== Advanced topics

So far we have covered the plain basics and we know how to set up, check and stop jobs now.

It is time to talk about the interesting parts now - otherwise the whole mention of
{29}[Kubernetes] would be quite pointless, right?

=== Scaling out

Running only one instance doesn\'t really justify the use of an orchestrator at all and there
might come a point when you really want to scale out.

If you paid attention to our previous example, you may have noticed there is a `count` parameter
and with it we can easily increase the designated number from e.g. 1 to 5 instances:

[source,hcl]
----
group "web" {
  count = 5
}
----

When we start another dry-run, {30}[Nomad] dutiful informs us, that we have port clash and cannot
run five instances on the same port:

image::plan_failure.png[]

A simple solution here is to configure different instances and set a fixed port for each, but we
can also use the {11}[dynamic port] feature of {30}[Nomad]:

We just have to remove the static port number from our {24}[job] definition - by basically removing
the configuration and force {30}[Nomad] to assign ports for us now:

[source,hcl]
----
network {
  port "http" {}
}
----

Secondly, we update the driver config to include some of the logic mentioned before in {16}[HCL]:

[source,hcl]
----
config {
  jar_path = "/Users/christoph.kappel/Projects/showcase-nomad-quarkus/target/showcase-nomad-quarkus-0.1-runner.jar"
  jvm_options = [
    "-Xmx256m", "-Xms256m",
    "-Dquarkus.http.port=${NOMAD_PORT_http}" # <1>
  ]
}
----
<1> This is a magic variable of {30}[Nomad] to assign a dynamic port to {32}[Quarkus].

And if we dry-run this again, we are greeted with following:

image::plan_update_scale.png[]

After final press of **Run** we can see another success and five running instances after a few
seconds:

image::update_success.png[]

Normally, our next step should be to install some kind of load balancer, add ports and addresses
of our instances and call it a day.
This involves lots of manual labor and also invites problems like changes of addresses and/or ports,
whenever {30}[Nomad] has to make a new allocation for an instance.

Alas, this is pretty common problem and already solved for us.

=== Service discovery

{37}[Service discovery] is basically a central catalog and every interested service can register
itself and fetch information about other registered services.

Our best pick from the many options is {6}[Consul], another product from {15}[HashiCorp], with an
obviously pretty good integration.

We can facilitate {30}[Nomad]\'s {2}[artifact] stanza in combination with the {34}[raw/exec] task
driver to fetch {6}[Consul] and run it directly from the internet:

[source,hcl]
----
job "consul" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]

  group "consul" {
    count = 1

    task "consul" {
      driver = "raw_exec" # <1>

      config {
        command = "consul"
        args    = ["agent", "-dev"]
      }

      artifact { # <2>
        source = "https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul/1.12.3/consul_1.12.3_darwin_amd64.zip"
      }
    }
  }
}
----
<1> Here we selected the {34}[raw/exec] task driver.
<2> This defines the source for the {2}[artifact] we want to execute.

The deployment is pretty much self-explanatory:

[source,shell]
----
$ nomad job run jobs/consul.nomad
==> 2022-07-20T12:15:24+02:00: Monitoring evaluation "eb0330c5"
    2022-07-20T12:15:24+02:00: Evaluation triggered by job "consul"
    2022-07-20T12:15:24+02:00: Evaluation within deployment: "c16677f8"
    2022-07-20T12:15:24+02:00: Allocation "7d9626b8" created: node "68168a84", group "consul"
    2022-07-20T12:15:24+02:00: Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> 2022-07-20T12:15:24+02:00: Evaluation "eb0330c5" finished with status "complete"
==> 2022-07-20T12:15:24+02:00: Monitoring deployment "c16677f8"
  âœ“ Deployment "c16677f8" successful

    2022-07-20T12:15:36+02:00
    ID          = c16677f8
    Job ID      = consul
    Job Version = 0
    Status      = successful
    Description = Deployment completed successfully

    Deployed
    Task Group  Desired  Placed  Healthy  Unhealthy  Progress Deadline
    consul      1        1       1        0          2022-07-20T12:25:34+02:00
----

After a few seconds {6}[Consul] is ready and we can have a look at its web-interface at
<http://localhost:8500>:

image::consul_services_nomad.png

The service tab shows all currently registered services and we can already see that {30}[Nomad] and
{6}[Consul] are automatically registered and listed.

In order for our services to appear, we need to add the {39}[service] stanza to our example:

[source,hcl]
----
service {
  name = "todo"
  port = "http"

  tags = [
    "urlprefix-/todo", # <1>
  ]

  check { # <2>
    type     = "http"
    path     = "/"
    interval = "2s"
    timeout  = "2s"
  }
}
----
<1> {30}[Nomad] allows to tag services - more about this specific tag in the next section.
<2> The {4}[check] stanza describes how {30}[Nomad] verifies, if this service is healthy.

A quick check after our modification before we run the {24}[job] to avoid surprises:

image::plan_update_service.png[]

The {21}[job plan] summarizes all options and sometimes gives good clues what else is possible in
the configuration.

After we've verified everything's alright, we run the {24}[job] and can see our instances in
{6}[Consul] shortly after:

image::consul_services_todo.png[]

NOTE: Here we can also see the port bindings of the instances quite easily.

And how do we route traffic to our instances?

=== Load balancing

Glad that you\'ve asked: Unfortunately, {30}[Nomad] cannot do that directly and it needs again help
from another tool.

One of the easiest options here with also a splendid integration of {6}[Consul] is the proxy
{13}[Fabio], but first things first.

Having a task scheduler at hand is really helping, so there are no surprises when we let {30}[Nomad]
do the work:

[source,hcl]
----
job "fabio" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]

  group "fabio" {
    count = 1

    task "fabio" {
      driver = "raw_exec"
      config {
        command = "fabio"
        args    = ["-proxy.strategy=rr"] # <1>
      }
      artifact {
        source      = "https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/releases/download/v1.6.1/fabio-1.6.1-darwin_amd64"
        destination = "local/fabio"
        mode        = "file"
      }
    }
  }
}
----
<1> This sets the round-robin strategy.

[source,shell]
----
$ nomad job plan jobs/fabio.nomad
+ Job: "fabio"
+ Task Group: "fabio" (1 create)
  + Task: "fabio" (forces create)

Scheduler dry-run:

----

There is no admin interface or anything, but we can see {13}[Fabio] listed in {6}[Consul] after
some seconds:

image::consul_services_fabio.png[]

The default port of {13}[Fabio] is `9999` and if we fire up again we see the expected result:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:9999/todo
*   Trying ::1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 9999 (#0)
> GET /todo HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:9999
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
> Accept: application/json
>
< HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
<
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
* Closing connection 0
----

Well, we can repeat the command from above and see the same result over and over again without
a chance to verify, if it really uses different instances.

A quick hack here is to add a custom header to our instances with IP and port:

[source,hcl]
----
config {
  jar_path = "/Users/christoph.kappel/Projects/showcase-nomad-quarkus/target/showcase-nomad-quarkus-0.1-runner.jar"
  jvm_options = [
    "-Xmx256m", "-Xms256m",
    "-Dquarkus.http.port=${NOMAD_PORT_http}",
    "-Dquarkus.http.header.TodoServer.value=${NOMAD_IP_http}:${NOMAD_PORT_http}", # <1>
    "-Dquarkus.http.header.TodoServer.path=/todo",
    "-Dquarkus.http.header.TodoServer.methods=GET"
  ]
}
----
<1> The added header combining IP and port.

[source,shell]
----
$ nomad job plan jobs/todo-java-scaled-service-header.nomad
+/- Job: "todo"
+/- Task Group: "web" (1 create/destroy update, 4 ignore)
  +/- Task: "todo" (forces create/destroy update)
    +/- Config {
        jar_path:       "/Users/christoph.kappel/Projects/showcase-nomad-quarkus/target/showcase-nomad-quarkus-0.1-runner.jar"
        jvm_options[0]: "-Xmx256m"
        jvm_options[1]: "-Xms256m"
        jvm_options[2]: "-Dquarkus.http.port=${NOMAD_PORT_http}"
      + jvm_options[3]: "-Dquarkus.http.header.TodoServer.value=${NOMAD_IP_http}:${NOMAD_PORT_http}"
      + jvm_options[4]: "-Dquarkus.http.header.TodoServer.path=/todo"

And if we repeat the commands now:

++++

    <div class="content">
        <img data-gifffer="/assets/images/nomad/loadbalancer.gif" />
    </div>
</div>

If you wonder why this even works in the first place without any kind of configuration:

One of the nice features of {13}[Fabio] is, that routes can be stored in {38}[service tags] and if
you have a closer look we already did that in our example with the tag `urlprefix-/todo`.

This tells {13}[Fabio] to redirect traffic to this prefix to instances by the same name, but there
are multiple other options best described in the {33}[quickstart guide].

=== Update strategies

At this point our example application is successfully running on our single node {30}[Nomad] cluster.
And we added a bit of fault tolerance and work distribution by putting each of the five instances
into an automatic load balanced group.

How do we proceed with updates of our application?

There are multiple strategies, one of the easiest is to update all instances in the same batch, but
that probably negates some of our previous efforts.
Another one is to update instances one by one, check if the update succeeds and proceed with the
next.
A third one is to update just one instance, verify this works as intended and update the remaining
ones.

All of the named strategies can be archived with the config options of the {42}[update] stanza and
{30}[Nomad] does a {36}[rolling update] by default and updates one after another until the desired
size is reached:

[source,hcl]
----
update {
  canary       = 1 # <1>
  max_parallel = 5 # <2>
}
----

<1> Defines how many instances should be included in a {3}[canary update].
<2> This sets the actual batch size for updates.

As a quick example, let us give a {3}[canary update] a try, but first we have to consider what will
happen once we start it:

A {3}[canary update] with `canary = 1` means, that our orchestrator starts one new instance and
waits, until we tell it to processed.
So conversely, we need means to check if the instance really works as expected **and** have a clear
way to distinguish it from the other instances in our group.

The previous trick with the header worked so well, why shouldn\'t we use it again?
That said, we just add another header to our {24}[job]:

[source,hcl]
----
config {
  jar_path = "/Users/christoph.kappel/Projects/showcase-nomad-quarkus/target/showcase-nomad-quarkus-0.1-runner.jar"
  jvm_options = [
    "-Xmx256m", "-Xms256m",
    "-Dquarkus.http.port=${NOMAD_PORT_http}",
    "-Dquarkus.http.header.TodoServer.value=${NOMAD_IP_http}:${NOMAD_PORT_http}",
    "-Dquarkus.http.header.TodoServer.path=/todo",
    "-Dquarkus.http.header.TodoServer.methods=GET",
    "-Dquarkus.http.header.TodoServerCanary.value=yes", # <1>
    "-Dquarkus.http.header.TodoServer.path=/todo",
    "-Dquarkus.http.header.TodoServer.methods=GET"
  ]
}
----
<1> The new header.

Again a quick glance at the plan and the deployment can start:

[source,shell]
----
$ nomad job plan jobs/todo-java-scaled-service-header-canary.nomad
+/- Job: "todo"
+/- Task Group: "web" (1 canary, 5 ignore)
  +/- Update {

      }
  +/- Task: "todo" (forces create/destroy update)
    +/- Config {
        jar_path:       "/Users/christoph.kappel/Projects/showcase-nomad-quarkus/target/showcase-nomad-quarkus-0.1-runner.jar"
        jvm_options[0]: "-Xmx256m"
        jvm_options[1]: "-Xms256m"
        jvm_options[2]: "-Dquarkus.http.port=${NOMAD_PORT_http}"
        jvm_options[3]: "-Dquarkus.http.header.TodoServer.value=${NOMAD_IP_http}:${NOMAD_PORT_http}"
        jvm_options[4]: "-Dquarkus.http.header.TodoServer.path=/todo"
        jvm_options[5]: "-Dquarkus.http.header.TodoServer.methods=GET"
      + jvm_options[6]: "-Dquarkus.http.header.TodoServerCanary.value=yes"
      + jvm_options[7]: "-Dquarkus.http.header.TodoServer.path=/todo"
      + jvm_options[8]: "-Dquarkus.http.header.TodoServer.methods=GET"
        }

Scheduler dry-run:
- All tasks successfully allocated.

The interesting part here is deployment actually stops and we have time to check, if our new
version works properly.

No new tricks - we just re-do the {8}[curl] check:

++++
<div class="imageblock">
    <div class="content">
        <img data-gifffer="/assets/images/nomad/canary.gif" />
    </div>
</div>
++++

This works perfectly well, time to tell {30}[Nomad] to continue with the deployment.
Again, there are multiple options like the {5}[CLI] {22}[job promote] call, but since we still have
a nice web-interface running:

image::promote_canary.png[]

After a quick press on **Promote Canary**, {30}[Nomad] continues with the update and concludes our
interrupted deployment.

image::promote_canary_success.png[]

== Conclusion

{30}[Nomad] is a really easy to use and flexible scheduler and there a multiple benefits from the
tight integration in other products - especially from direct {15}[HashiCorp] products.

I think it shouldn\'t shy away from a comparison with {28}[Kubernetes] and offers solutions to many
of the daily problems like:

- Service discovery
- Healthchecks and failover
- Load balancing
- Update strategies
